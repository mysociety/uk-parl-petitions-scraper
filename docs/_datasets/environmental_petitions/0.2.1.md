      example: The chaos engulfing the UK government is unprecedented. Over 40 ministers
        resigned leaving departments without leadership during cost of living, energy
        and climate crises. War rages in Ukraine; the Northern Ireland Protocol has
        further damaged our relationship with Europe; recession looms; the UK itself
        may cease to exist as Scotland seeks independence. This is the greatest set
        of challenges we have seen in our lifetimes. Let the people decide who leads
        us through this turmoil.
