That is why we have established the Storm Overflows Taskforce and have announced plans for legislation to address this problem.", "details": "All discharges to the water environment, including from storm overflows, require a permit issued by the Environment Agency under the Environmental Permitting Regulations. The permits contain the necessary conditions to regulate the discharge and protect the environment. Compliance with permits is assessed by the Environment Agency. Any non-compliance is reported and will be subject to appropriate action under the Environment Agency\u2019s enforcement and sanctions guidance. The Environment Agency will continue to prosecute water companies which fail to uphold the law or cause serious environmental harm.\r\n\r\nStorm overflows were designed to be used during extreme weather to prevent sewers becoming overloaded with a combination of sewage and rainwater, releasing diluted wastewater into rivers rather than letting it back up into people\u2019s homes. Climate change has led to increased rainfall and water infrastructure has not kept pace with development growth over decades. Storm overflows are a last resort in modern sewer design, but the age of our sewerage systems means their complete elimination is not practicable or affordable.\r\n \r\nWe recognise that there is more to do with regards to the management of sewage pollution. Rebecca Pow MP, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defra, has met water company CEOs and made clear that the volume of sewage discharged into rivers and other waterways in extreme weather must be reduced. To achieve this, Defra has established the Storm Overflows Taskforce, bringing together representatives from Government, the water industry, regulators and environmental non-governmental organisations to set out clear proposals to accelerate progress in tackling this issue. \r\n\r\nThis Taskforce has agreed a long-term goal to eliminate harm from storm overflows and has taken steps to improve monitoring and transparency. Eliminating harm from storm overflows is a generational endeavour that will involve significant change and it will take time to achieve, but the Government is determined to accelerate efforts towards this goal. The Taskforce is now working on plans to start making progress towards this goal and has commissioned research to gather evidence on the costs, benefits and feasibility of different options. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn 29 March, the Government also announced new measures would be put into law to reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows. Three key duties will be made law:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 A duty on Government to publish a plan by September 2022 to reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows and to reduce their impact;\r\n\r\n\u00b7 A duty on Government to report to Parliament on progress on implementing the plan;\r\n\r\n\u00b7 A duty on water companies and the Environment Agency to publish data on storm overflow operation on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this announcement at:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/measures-to-reduce-harm-from-storm-overflows-to-be-made-law\r\n\r\nThese legally-binding obligations on water companies and the Government will reduce pollution in rivers and will therefore protect wildlife and public health.\r\n\r\nAlongside these new duties, water companies have agreed to make available real-time data on sewage discharges from storm overflows at designated bathing waters all year round from this year. This data will be made available to help surfers, swimmers and other recreational water users to check the latest information and make informed choices on where to swim.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these new measures, water companies are already committed to an existing \u00a31.1 billion programme of action in the current five-year business planning period (2020 to 2025) to improve the monitoring and management of storm overflows. This includes the installation of monitoring devices on the vast majority of storm overflows, 800 investigations and 798 improvement schemes to storm overflows.\r\n \r\nWater companies have also committed to accelerate work to install monitoring devices to create a complete picture of the impact of storm overflows by 2023. This will help us to understand the impacts of storm overflows at all sites and to target improvements to where they are needed.\r\n\r\nFinally, water companies are currently producing comprehensive Drainage and Wastewater Management Plans to assess the capacity of and risks to their wastewater networks over a 25-year planning horizon. We are also taking steps through the Environment Bill to place these Plans on a statutory basis. They will be another tool to help address the risks that storm overflows pose to the environment.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n", "created_at": "2021-05-06T10:34:38.929Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-06T10:34:38.929Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-11-15", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-11-15/debates/21111537000002/WaterCompaniesSewageDischarge", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YauNgmUMasQ", "debate_pack_url": "", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 586378, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/586378.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Give the Environment Agency the funds and freedom to protect English rivers", "background": "The Government must reverse years of cuts to Agency budgets, increase charges for polluters, and give the Agency freedom from overly business-friendly Government codes and guidance, so it can pursue and achieve its principal statutory objective to protect and enhance English rivers", "additional_details": "Over 10% of freshwater species are threatened with extinction and two thirds are in decline, including salmon.

These new targets will be an important mechanism to drive environmental improvement and meet our ambitious objectives for the water environment in the 25 Year Environment Plan.  \r\n\r\nThe Act places clear duties on water and sewerage companies to progressively reduce the adverse impacts of discharges from storm overflows and improve transparency of reporting when discharges occur.  \r\n\r\nThe Environment Agency is driving transparency with 80% of storm overflows now having Event Duration Monitors and all overflows will be monitored by the end of 2023, allowing water companies to report the frequency and duration of spills to the Environment Agency (EA) each year so they can assess compliance. The Environment Agency is acting on new information, suggesting that some water companies in England may indeed not be complying with their permits and a major Environment Agency/Ofwat investigation has been launched.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to funding the EA to improve the water environment. For example, we are providing additional funding to the EA to increase their farm inspection regime nationwide over the next 18 months. In 2021/2 this includes an expectation of a fourfold increase in farm inspections undertaken nationally with plans to scale up further in 2022/3.\r\n\r\nWhilst necessary to uphold basic standards, enforcement of the regulations alone are not sufficient because farmers need advice to understand the risks posed to water by agriculture and funding support where actions beyond regulatory requirements are needed to reduce pollution further.\r\n\r\nWe are expanding the Catchment Sensitive Farming Programme, almost doubling its funding by providing an additional \u00a317 million over the next three years to enable it to cover 100% of farms in England. Over the last 15 years this programme has been one of the main ways to help farmers tackle pollution which results from manure, fertiliser and soil running off into rivers when it rains. It provides free 1-2-1 advice to farmers to help them reduce water and air pollution through management of nutrients, soils, animals and infrastructure among other things.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-12-17T13:46:53.799Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-17T13:46:53.799Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 577582, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/577582.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Remove the otter\u2019s protected species status", "background": "The Eurasian otter (Lutra Lutra) is now firmly established in the river systems across the UK and appear to be in far greater numbers than anyone can recall.", "additional_details": "We believe the protection afforded by a number of priority species lists and The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 should be removed as it is no longer appropriate, in order to protect and maintain a balanced riverine environment.", "committee_note": "", "state": "closed", "signature_count": 5318, "created_at": "2021-03-02T12:09:14.517Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-08T23:00:07.400Z", "rejected_at": null, "opened_at": "2021-04-08T15:50:57.108Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-08T22:59:59.999Z", "moderation_threshold_reached_at": "2021-03-02T20:09:25.000Z", "response_threshold_reached_at": null, "government_response_at": null, "debate_threshold_reached_at": null, "scheduled_debate_date": null, "debate_outcome_at": null, "creator_name": null, "rejection": null, "government_response": null, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 330416, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/330416.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban \u2018permitted discharge\u2019 of foul water into rivers ", "background": "Stop utility companies from being able to discharge foul water into the rivers, other than in the infrequent times of heavy rainstorms. \r\n", "additional_details": "Utility companies are depositing more and more raw sewerage into UK rivers.
