This will be the world\u2019s first net zero cap and trade market, delivering a robust carbon price signal and promoting cost-effective decarbonisation by allowing businesses to cut carbon where it is cheapest to do so. \r\n\r\nThe UK ETS covers emissions from power generation, energy intensive industries and aviation. Alongside this, the Carbon Price Support rate on fossil fuels used in electricity generation will ensure that a strong decarbonisation signal is maintained to ensure a downwards trajectory in power sector emissions as we push to fully drive out coal.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 Energy White Paper committed to exploring expanding the UK ETS to the two thirds of emissions not currently covered by the UK ETS, and set out our aspirations to continue to lead the world on carbon pricing in the run up to COP26 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government is also determined to tackle air pollution given its significant negative impact on public health, the economy and the environment. Air quality has improved significantly over recent decades thanks to the action we have already taken. \r\n\r\nThe Government continues to take action to reduce emissions and improve air quality through the vehicle tax system. Users of zero and ultra-low emission vehicles have beneficial Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and company car tax (CCT) rates in comparison to conventionally fuelled vehicles. To improve air quality, new diesel models that do not meet the Real Driving Emissions 2 (RDE2) standard for nitrogen oxide emissions have also gone up by one VED band on first registration and the CCT supplement for diesel cars that do not meet the latest RDE2 standard has increased from 3 to 4%. \r\n\r\nTo tackle climate change and improve air quality the Government will also be removing the entitlement to use red diesel from most sectors from April 2022. This means that most businesses using diesel across the UK will need to use fuel taxed at the standard rate for diesel, which more fairly reflects the harmful impact of the emissions they produce.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission\u2019s figure of \u20ac10.5bn for UK subsidies to fossil fuels comes from the report \u201cEnergy prices and costs in Europe\u201d which uses OECD inventory methodology as a basis for its findings. This is a broader concept of support than that of the International Energy Agency, which the UK follows. It references a broader range of support measures, including many that do not reduce consumer prices below world market levels. Such mechanisms are classified as support without reference to the purpose for which they were first put in place or their economic or environmental effects. The OECD is clear that they therefore make no judgement as to whether or not such measures are inefficient or ought to be reformed.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the UK does not give any subsidies to fossil fuels and is a longstanding supporter of multilateral efforts to promote fossil fuel subsidy reform since these were first proposed in 2009, including through the G20, & the G7. We support the G20 commitment to rationalise and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies across the globe and see clear benefits in doing so.\r\n\r\nIn June 2019, the UK became the first major economy to legislate to end our net contribution to climate change by 2050. The government also accepted the Committee for Climate Change\u2019s recommendation that the Treasury should undertake a review into the costs of transitioning to Net Zero. The Interim Report, published in December 2020, is the first publication from the Treasury\u2019s Net Zero Review. It is a discussion document that sets out the analysis so far and seeks feedback ahead of the Final Report, due in spring 2021. The Final Report will take this analysis further, focusing on innovation and growth, competitiveness, household impacts, and embedding the findings.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury\r\n", "created_at": "2021-04-01T16:56:58.611Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-01T16:56:58.611Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-11-01", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-11-01/debates/F2982AB2-6D9F-4D5B-8720-D4EC7F36CDF8/CarbonEmissionCharges", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdhBpY_3NNI", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2021-0177/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "HMT", "name": "HM Treasury", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608295, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608295.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Introduce an \"Ecological Damage Tax\" on Astroturf Lawns / Artificial Grass", "background": "Introduce a tax on Astroturf Lawns (either on the import, sale or install) in order to act as a deterrent and encourage land owners towards less damaging and more sustainable \"low maintenance\" landscaping options that are good for wildlife and climate.", "additional_details": "UK Gardens occupy more land than our Nature Reserves combined and are vital habitats for wildlife, providing food, shelter and a home for so many declining species.

The Government will pay cash grants of 80% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500, providing workers stay employed. The Scheme covers the cost of wages backdated to 1 March. It was initially open for at least three months and has now been extended to the end of October. There is no limit on the amount of funding available for the scheme, and all UK-wide employers with a PAYE scheme are eligible. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCoronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme - has been created to support long-term viable small and medium sized businesses who may need to respond to cash-flow pressures by seeking additional finance. To be eligible, a business must be based in the UK and be impacted by COVID-19, have an annual turnover of no more than \u00a345 million, and be seeking a loan up to \u00a35 million. The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank.

The Government will provide a guarantee to enable banks to make these loans. It will support business that were viable before the COVID-19 outbreak, which are otherwise unable to access the finance they need.\r\n\r\nThe above measures have been designed to ensure that companies of any size receive the help they need to get through this difficult time.\r\n\r\nThe Government has made up to \u00a3617m of additional funding available to local authorities to enable them to make payments of up to \u00a325,000 to businesses which are ineligible for the existing grants schemes because of the way they interact with the business rates system. The guidance for local authorities on implementation of the business rates Expanded Retail Discount includes a list of properties eligible for the relief. Eligibility for the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund is also taken from this list. This list does not provide specifically for properties used by coach businesses to benefit from the relief, and specifically makes ineligible properties that are not reasonably accessible to visiting members of the public. It is for local authorities to determine in each individual case when to grant business rates relief or grants, having regard to this guidance. Where businesses feel they may fit the eligibility criteria for business rates relief or grants, they should contact their local authority. Local authorities also have the discretionary power to offer hardship relief.\r\n\r\nGiven the support already put in place, as outlined above, the Government at this time has no plans to provide additional financial support bespoke to the coach industry.\r\n\r\nFurther details of all these schemes and support can be found at: www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19.\r\n\r\nThe online business support finder tool can be found at: www.gov.uk/business-coronavirus-support-finder.\r\n\r\nSchool Restart funding was also announced on 8th August, providing local transport authorities with more than \u00a340 million funding for the autumn term to create extra capacity, while social distancing measures remain in place.\r\n\r\nGuidance for School Restart funding can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-to-school-and-other-places-of-education-autumn-term-2020\r\n\r\nThe Government continues to work closely with the coach sector to understand what the ongoing risks and issues are, and how these could be addressed, and we are reviewing opportunities for the sector to assist in wider recovery and resilience work.

We set out in our Resources and Waste Strategy (2018) that we are committed to moving towards a more circular economy. That means we will continue to prioritise measures to prevent waste occurring in the first place, but where waste does occur, we should be maximising its resource value and minimising its environmental impact.\r\n\r\nWe consulted on a new Waste Prevention Programme between March and June 2021 which builds on the Resources and Waste Strategy and seeks to establish a programme which helps with our strategic goals including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net zero, as well as increasing our resource productivity and minimising waste. Subject to the results of that consultation, it will propose action across seven key sectors \u2013 construction; textiles; furniture; electrical and electronics products; road vehicles; packaging, plastics and single-use items; and food \u2013 to minimise waste and work towards a more resource efficient economy. This includes steps to use resources more efficiently, design and manufacture products for optimum life and repair and reuse more items. We expect to publish our revised Programme following the consultation shortly.\r\n\r\nAll local authorities and waste operators are already required, under the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 on the transfer of waste, to collect, treat and dispose of waste in accordance with the waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste management options.\u202fThis requires the prevention of waste in the first place (such as reuse or reduction of materials), and where this is not possible, preparing items for reuse. If neither prevention nor preparing for re-use is possible, then recycling is the next best option, followed by energy recovery (such as energy from waste). Disposal without energy recovery, such as landfill, is regarded as the worst option. Subject to some limited exceptions, regulation 13 requires the separate collection of waste paper, metal, plastic and glass and regulation 14 requires that separately collected waste is not mixed with other material with different properties. Following this, in 2020 we introduced a ban on sending waste paper, metal, plastic and glass that is separately collected for recycling or preparing for re-use to landfill or incineration.\t\r\n\r\nWhen waste cannot be prevented or reused, the waste hierarchy states that it should be recycled where possible. The Environment Act 2021 inserts new requirements into the Environmental Protection Act 1990 for all local authorities in England to make arrangements for a core set of materials (paper and card; glass; metal; plastic; food waste; and garden waste) to be collected separately for recycling from households. These include requirements on businesses and non-domestic premises, such as schools and hospitals, to present the same waste streams for separate collection, except garden waste, and arrange for their separate collection.\r\n\r\nWe recently consulted on measures to increase the consistency in recycling in line with the new provisions in the Environmental Protection Act. This will ensure that there is more recycled material in the products we\u202fbuy,\u202fand\u202fthat\u202fthe UK recycling industry\u202fgrows. Whilst we want to introduce consistency in recycling as quickly as possible, we recognise local authorities and businesses will need time to adapt to the changes. We expect to publish a full Government response to our consultation in early 2022 and intend to consult further on statutory guidance in 2022.\r\n\r\nThese measures will constitute a significant step towards meeting our 25 Year Environment Plan commitment to eliminate avoidable waste by 2050 and\u202fcontribute towards meeting\u202frecycling targets, including our commitment of 65% of municipal (household-like) waste to be recycled by 2035, with no more than 10% ending up in landfill.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the impact of the landfill tax on the percentage of waste sent to landfill. In England, 8.5% of local authority managed waste went to landfill in 2019/20. By continuing to incentivise the diversion of waste away from landfill to be managed further up the waste hierarchy through the Landfill Tax, the Government is making strong progress towards the goal of no more than 10% of municipal waste to landfill by 2035.\r\n\r\nThe planned introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and a Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) will also help incentivise recycling of plastic and metal. More details will be communicated in the Government responses to the public consultations for EPR and DRS which were held in 2021.

This supports lower fares, better availability of routes and higher service quality.\r\n\r\nUnder these rules, airlines that use our most crowded airports (that are slot coordinated under the Worldwide Airport Slot Guidelines) must operate at least 80% of slots during the current season, or risk losing their historic rights: the so-called \u201880:20\u2019 rule.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a severe shock for aviation demand which has continued to remain considerably suppressed. The usual competition rules, which were designed for a situation where airports enjoyed high levels of usage, were not appropriate when demand had fallen close to zero. As such, the rules requiring airlines to use slots in order to retain their historic rights were fully suspended for the Summer 2020, Winter 2020/21 and Summer 2021 seasons.\r\n\r\nThe UK\u2019s exit from the European Union means that it has been able to take a more tailored approach that reflect the UK\u2019s specific circumstances. The Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft (ATMUA) Act 2021 provides temporary powers to amend these rules where the evidence supports the need to do so. These powers last until August 2024, covering the Winter 2024/25 season.\r\n\r\nAs the pandemic has gone on and demand begins to recover, the Government is keen to support recovery. For the current Winter 2021/22 season the Government has used the ATMUA Act 2021 to amend the slot usage retention rules. For Winter 2021/22 this has been reduced from 80% to 50%, and we have also allowed airlines to hand back full series of slots before the start of the season if they are not going to fly them. The provision to allow airlines to hand back full series of slots goes further than the equivalent alleviation in the European Union for Winter 2021/22 which did not include a full series hand back. By encouraging airlines to hand back their slots where there is insufficient demand, this has dramatically reduced the volume of empty or almost empty flights. This has also provided other airlines with the opportunity to make use of these slots, where there is sufficient demand, with new entrants being awarded temporary slots at some of our most congested airports. \r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the latest available data and evidence, the Secretary of State decided that alleviation remains justified for the Summer 2022 season.\r\n\r\nA draft Statutory Instrument setting out arrangements for Summer 2022 was published on 24 January 2022. The measures balance supporting recovery, protection for those carriers operating in markets that are severely restricted and reducing environmental impacts. It sets a minimum usage ratio of 70% and strengthens the provisions for justified non-utilisation of slots.\r\n\r\nThe strengthened justified non-use provision protects carriers and avoids the environmental impact of empty or almost empty flights flying where COVID-19 related restrictions are in place and avoids empty or almost empty flights to destinations that have onerous travel restrictions. This is because carriers can now use justified non-use provision to cover foreseeable restrictions, even where  restrictions are in place before the start of the season. The UK also will now allow for early applications for justified non-use such as where long term restrictions are in place.\r\n\r\nThese slot alleviation measures are only temporary, however as part of the Government\u2019s future aviation policy we are actively looking at reform to the airport slot allocation process. We are developing the case and options for reforms to make the best use of airport capacity and deliver a better outcome for passengers.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that the aviation sector has a critical role to play in delivering the UK\u2019s net zero commitments. In July 2021 we published the Jet Zero Consultation which sets out our vision for the sector to reach net zero by 2050. The consultation closed in September and we continue to carefully consider responses in the development of our final Jet Zero Strategy which we aim to publish later this year.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already supporting a variety of technology, fuel and market-based measures to address aviation emissions. The Net Zero Strategy published in October 2021 confirmed our commitment to Jet Zero, for the UK to become a world-leader in zero emission flight and to build a world-leading sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. The Government announced \u00a3180 million of additional funding for the development of SAF plants in the UK, further supporting our ambition to see 10% SAF blended into the UK fuel mix by 2030.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2022-02-28T16:30:06.318Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-28T16:30:06.318Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 617573, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/617573.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Require all new builds to have solar panels as condition of planning permission", "background": "Make it mandatory for all new buildings to be fitted with solar panels as a condition of planning permission.

However we expect most developers will use solar panels to meet the recent uplift in energy efficiency standards.", "details": "The Government is committed to meeting its target of net zero emissions by 2050 and renewable energy, such as that generated from solar panels, is a key part of our strategy to get to net zero.\r\n \r\nPlanning policy cannot set specific building standards, that is the role of Building Regulations. The Building Regulations set standards for the design, construction and alteration of buildings, which means they are an important mechanism for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. The Regulations are technology-neutral and therefore do not ban or mandate specific technologies. This provides developers with flexibility to innovate and choose the most appropriate and cost-effective solutions for their site. For instance, some homes may not be suitable for solar panels due to reasons such as shading, orientation, and roof size/shape.\r\n \r\nWe recognise, however, the important role that rooftop solar panels can play in making buildings more energy efficient. We must therefore take the opportunity, where appropriate, to fit solar panels.\r\n\r\nIn December 2021 the Government introduced an uplift in energy efficiency standards, which came into force in June 2022. The uplift delivers a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions, with new homes now expected to produce around 30% less CO2 emissions and new non-domestic buildings expected to produce around 27% less CO2 emissions compared to those built to the previous standards. We expect that to meet the new standards, most new homes and buildings will be built with solar panels. Where they do not include solar panels, they are likely to include other low carbon heating technology, such as heat pumps. \r\n\r\nThe uplift is a stepping-stone towards the 2025 Future Homes and Buildings Standards, which will deliver even higher energy efficiency standards. From 2025, new homes and buildings will be \u2018zero carbon ready\u2019, which means that no further retrofit work for energy efficiency will be necessary to enable them to become zero-carbon as the electricity grid continues to decarbonise. We expect heat pumps will become the primary heating technology for new buildings under the Future Homes and Buildings Standards. Other green technologies, such as solar panels, will also continue to play an important role. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the planning framework, our National Planning Policy Framework sets out policies that encourage local planning authorities to consider the use and supply of renewable and low carbon energy and heat through plan making and when determining planning applications.\r\n \r\nThere are a range of nationally set permitted development rights that allow for the installation of micro-generation equipment, including rooftop solar panels on domestic and non-domestic properties, without having to make a planning application. We will keep the existing permitted development rights for solar equipment under regular review.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities", "created_at": "2022-11-23T17:34:53.033Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-23T17:34:53.033Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 552296, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/552296.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Enshrine tree planting target in law", "background": "The UK is hosting the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference and has already enshrined a net zero carbon emissions target in law.
