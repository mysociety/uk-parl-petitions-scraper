This railway will play a vital role in delivering the Government\u2019s carbon net zero objectives.", "details": "The Government has carefully considered the merits and disadvantages of proceeding with HS2 and has firmly concluded that it should go ahead. HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, and help to rebalance opportunity fairly across the country. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.  During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history. \r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament. The Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable. Just this month, Andrew Stephenson MP, the dedicated HS2 minister, went before the Transport Select Committee to discuss HS2 in depth, and a record of this hearing can be found on Parliament.UK. \r\n\r\nMinisters have made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. \r\n\r\nWe are continuing work on managing the full impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on delivery of the HS2 programme. We intend to update Parliament on the latest position as part of the next six-monthly Parliamentary Report, expected in Spring 2021. \r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. The environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One. Alongside the Act, the Government also published a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project. \r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. Phase One expects to support 33 square kilometres of wildlife habitat - an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations. \r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nSecuring the land and property needed to construct the line of route across all Phases is vital to the programme\u2019s success and is often the first impact that we have on line of route communities. A range of statutory and non-statutory property compensation schemes are available that seek to compensate affected parties fairly while protecting the public purse.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to provide fair compensation for those directly and indirectly impacted but the process and disputes for claims can inevitably be traumatic for some. Andrew Stephenson commissioned a detailed review of the acquisition and compensation process to ensure that there is a renewed focus on those who are being impacted by the new railway. The report contained 36 recommendations which are actively being implemented which will see rapid improvements for local communities. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to repeal any legislation relating to the development and delivery of HS2.  However, we will continue to welcome further public and parliamentary scrutiny of the project. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-09-13", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-09-13/debates/3614AE85-A25C-4874-9DAE-9802247DFDDF/HS2", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yt-9ZsO5vg", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9313/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608056, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608056.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Nationalise Energy Companies", "background": "The Government needs to take back ownership of strategic energy assets.

Properly regulated markets provide the best outcome for consumers as a driver of efficiency and innovation.", "details": "The Government does not agree that nationalisation of the country\u2019s strategic energy assets is the right approach.  A renationalised energy company would still have to buy the same expensive gas on global markets, so prices won't be lowered. Furthermore, if the Government renationalised energy companies, the British taxpayer would have to compensate directors, shareholders, and creditors to the tune of tens of billions of pounds \u2013 money that would be better spent supporting families.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, nationalised utilities run by politicians were in a bad state. These monopolies made considerable losses, were inefficient and needed considerable investment to upgrade age-old infrastructure. Since privatisation in the 1980s, the UK\u2019s energy system has attracted hundreds of billions of pounds in private capital \u2013 money that otherwise would have had to come from higher taxes or additional borrowing. This investment improved performance and reliability of Britain\u2019s energy network and offered consumers greater choice and higher standards of products and services. \r\n\r\nThe Government therefore continues to believe that properly regulated markets, which incentivise private capital to invest in the energy system, provide the best outcome for consumers and promote market competition as the best driver of efficiency, innovation and value.   This approach has served consumers well since energy privatisation, catalysing billions of pounds of investment and improving performance and reliability and offering consumers greater choice and higher standards of products and services.  \r\n\r\nThe Government has set out a comprehensive long-term plan for greater energy independence. The more clean, affordable power we generate within our borders, the less exposed we will be to eye watering fossil fuel prices set by global markets we can\u2019t control.\r\n\r\nThrough our Energy Security Strategy, we are working to our vulnerability to international oil and gas prices by reducing our dependence on expensive oil and gas. We will do this by accelerating the deployment of wind, new nuclear, solar and hydrogen, whilst supporting North Sea oil and gas in the nearer term for security of supply.\r\n\r\nNationalisation will not solve the current challenge of high global fossil fuel prices and the impact this is having on the cost of energy.  The Government has set out a comprehensive long-term plan for the energy system through the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution and Energy White Paper, both of 2020, and the British Energy Security Strategy of 2022.  These present a vision for how Britain can enjoy secure, clean and affordable home-grown energy for the long term.  In particular, the Energy Security Strategy charts a pathway to address our vulnerability to international oil and gas prices, by reducing our dependence on imported oil and gas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Government recognises that households and businesses across the UK are rightly concerned about rising energy bills.  We are taking action at an unprecedented scale.\r\n\r\nThe Government is providing \u00a337 billion of support this year, targeted at those who are most in need with the cost of living. This includes a \u00a315 billion Energy Bill Support Scheme, worth up to \u00a3400 each for around 28 million households. In addition, targeted support includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022 More than 8 million households on means tested benefits will receive a payment of \u00a3650\r\n\r\n\u2022 Over 8 million pensioner households which receive the Winter Fuel Payment will also receive a \u00a3300 Cost of Living Payment\r\n\r\n\u2022 Six million households which receive disability support will receive \u00a3150 Disability Cost of Living Payment\r\n\r\nAlongside this the Government is investing over \u00a36.6 billion over this parliament to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise heating. We will deliver upgrades to over half a million homes in the coming years through our Social Housing Decarbonisation, Home Upgrade Grant Schemes and Energy Company Obligation Scheme, delivering average bill savings of \u00a3300.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we have extended the Energy Company Obligation 2022 to 2026, boosting its value from \u00a3640 million to \u00a31 billion a year. This is helping an extra 450,000 families with green measures such as insulation. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "created_at": "2022-09-01T16:17:52.031Z", "updated_at": "2022-09-01T16:17:52.031Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2022-10-31", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-31/debates/D2E93BD7-1A0E-40FA-8829-0B3D9412F589/PublicOwnershipOfEnergyCompanies", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPBvGhYde4E", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2022-0184/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "BEIS", "name": "Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 330298, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/330298.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Take action to end factory farming and reduce meat and dairy consumption", "background": "In order to improve public health, combat climate change and reduce animal suffering, the Government should:\r\n\r\n1.

There are a number of different farming systems in use within the UK and farms of all sizes have a role to play in promoting sustainable agriculture. Increasing the size of herds does not necessarily equate to lower animal health or welfare standards. All farms must comply with comprehensive UK law on animal health and welfare, planning, veterinary medicines and environmental legislation. Stockmanship and high husbandry standards are key to ensuring high welfare standards for all farmed animals.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, we can be justly proud that we have amongst the highest standards of animal welfare in the world. We are developing an Animal Health and Welfare Pathway which will promote the production of healthier, higher welfare animals. Improving animal health underpins the welfare of farmed animals; reduces greenhouse gas emissions; slows the rise of anti-microbial resistance; better protects farmers and the public from the economic impacts of disease; and helps demonstrate a commitment to rising standards of animal health and welfare to our current and future trading partners across the world.\r\n\r\nMeat and dairy consumption\r\n\r\nThe National Food Strategy independent review will advise the government on how we can best enable the food system to provide sustainable food and support healthy diets for everyone. Part One of the National Food Strategy was published on 29 July and contained seven recommendations covering financial support for children in low income families, governance on food vulnerability, and trade. A further report will follow in 2021, examining our food system as a whole, to ensure everyone has access to healthy, affordable food that is sustainably produced. We will be carefully considering the findings of this report and will be responding with a white paper within six months of the final publication.\r\n\r\nAs the first major economy to legislate for Net Zero by 2050, targeting greenhouse gases is a priority for this Government. We are clear that adapting best practice across all farming systems is a crucial part of this. The cornerstone of our new agricultural policy, the Environmental Land Management Scheme, will support farmers to deliver environmental public goods by paying them public money to do so. Additionally, measures in the Agriculture Bill, the National Food Strategy and the 25 Year Environment Plan will enable farmers to optimise sustainable food production and reduce emissions.\r\n\r\nThe government advocates for a healthy balanced diet, based on the national food model the Eatwell Guide. Meat and dairy can both be an important part of a balanced diet. We are also clear that our diets should include more fibre, fruit and vegetables.\r\n \r\nWe have already seen significant progress in cutting emissions but there is more to be done across the economy, including in agriculture. We will work with our fantastic farmers to do this, acknowledging that well managed livestock provides environmental benefits including biodiversity, protecting the character of the countryside and generating important income for rural communities. We should be proud of our high quality; high welfare UK produce which is recognised around the world.\r\n\r\nNext year we will host COP26, where we will be seeking to secure international action on climate change and biodiversity loss.

This commitment is  stated in the National Planning Policy Framework and supporting guidance, to which all local planning authorities should have regard when drawing up local plans, or determining planning applications.  The Framework expects local authorities to not only protect landscapes, soils and sites of biodiversity but go further by enhancing these valued surroundings. The Framework also outlines that the character and beauty of the countryside, including trees and woodland, should be recognised in the planning of future development.  Strong protections are in place for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated land. The Government will continue to apply policy and law as appropriate to prevent harm to wildlife-rich habitat, and to restrict development in open countryside.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to making the most of brownfield land.  The Framework strongly encourages regeneration and re-use of brownfield, especially for housing - helping to level up communities across the country while taking off some of the pressure to consider other land, such as Green Belt, for new homes. The Framework expects local authorities to give substantial weight to re-using suitable brownfield when Plan-making or deciding planning applications. These sites should be given priority where practical and viable, and local authorities should consider building up, and higher densities in towns.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n- the term \u2018brownfield\u2019 comprises almost all types of previously developed land, including inhabited housing and land occupied by functioning businesses and industry;   \r\n- not all vacant brownfield is in the right place for sustainable residential use; \r\n- some is valuable for ecology; \r\n- some has high upfront costs for demolition or decontamination; \r\n- each local authority is already required by law to publish a register of brownfield land in its area that would be suitable for housing-led development;\r\n- not all owners will wish to develop or release sites, for different reasons; and \r\n- the rules on compulsory purchase of building sites are strict, and generally require compensation for the owner, reflecting the current land value.\r\n\r\nElected local authorities are responsible for deciding the right location and type of sustainable future development in each area, in accordance with national policies in the Framework. Rightly, planning decisions are not made on the basis of the number of objectors or supporters. Instead, each local authority is responsible for preparing a vision for future development in its area using a Local Plan. The Local Plan outlines how land should be used and takes account of any necessary restraints on development. The Plan is created in consultation with the local community, and submitted for rigorous independent examination by a planning inspector. If the Plan is judged to be properly prepared, justified, and consistent with national policy in the Framework, it can come into effect. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that to help make home ownership affordable for more people, and help more people rent their own home, we need to deliver more homes. To get enough homes built in the places where people and communities need them, a crucial first step is to plan for the right number of homes. Local housing need introduced in 2018 is a measure of an area\u2019s housing need, against which councils must then consider their local circumstances and supply pipeline. Local authorities draw up a local housing target, taking into account factors including land availability and environmental constraints such as Green Belt. Following consultation to changes to the method (from August to October 2020) on 16 December 2020 we changed the formula to increase need in the 20 most populated urban areas. \r\n\r\nProtecting the Green Belt remains a priority and our national planning policy reinforces regenerating previously developed land, known as brownfield sites, and prioritising urban areas. The uplift in local housing needed within our biggest cities and urban centres in England will direct homes to where they are better served by infrastructure, and therefore protect our countryside. It also supports our wider objectives of regenerating brownfield sites, renewal, and levelling up. Green Belt decisions as outlined above will remain with local authorities and communities, ensuring they have influence over development, location and design.\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to apply strong policies to limit harm to Green Belt and the countryside, this Government is encouraging local authorities to make the most of their brownfield land. We are providing extensive financial support for this.  For example, in 2020 the Prime Minister announced that seven Mayoral Combined Authorities would receive a share of the \u00a3400 million Brownfield Housing Fund. This will help unlock 26,000 homes across England by bringing under-utilised brownfield land back into use. In addition we are investing \u00a375 million in a Brownfield Land Release Fund for authorities not eligible for the Brownfield Housing Fund. This is new capital funding to accelerate release of local authority-owned land for housing. The Brownfield Land Release Fund is expected to release land for 7,000 homes by 2024.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government", "created_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 300919, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300919.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the sale of artificial grass", "background": "The sale of artificial grass should be banned in the UK for environmental reasons.
