To this end, we operate a strict system for regulating pesticides.\r\n\r\nA pesticide may only be placed on the market in the UK if the product has been authorised by our regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, following a thorough risk assessment, which includes impacts on people, animals and the environment. If there are found to be unacceptable risks, to pollinators for example, the product is not authorised. The risk assessment also specifically addresses the situation of people living near where pesticides are used. Pesticide users are legally required to ensure that use is kept to the area to be treated and not allowed to drift onto neighbouring properties, and there are statutory conditions of use for all authorised pesticide products that must be followed. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to supporting alternatives to chemical pesticides. In our 25 Year Environment Plan, the Government has outlined its approach to reducing the environmental impact of pesticides. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) lies at the heart of our approach to maximise the use of non-chemical control techniques and minimise the use of chemical pesticides. IPM is defined as the combined use of all available control methods. This means that pesticide users can take a holistic approach in reducing the associated risks (including indirect effects) whilst combating pest resistance. IPM also includes measures to optimise pesticide application, with the aim of reducing non target effects and unnecessary environmental exposure. This includes increasing the use of nature-based, low toxicity solutions and precision technologies, with the potential to enhance biodiversity, as well as benefit pollinators.   \r\n \r\nOur approach is detailed in the draft revised \u2018National Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides\u2019 (NAP), which sets out the ambition to improve indicators of pesticide usage, risk and impacts. This was the subject of a recent public consultation, with over 1,500 responses received and analysed. The summary of responses will be published in due course and the revised NAP later this year.  \r\n  \r\nThe objective must be to reduce the risks and impacts associated with pesticides. These depend not only on the amount of pesticide used, but which pesticide is used and where use takes place. The draft revised NAP supports the development of low toxicity methods and improved advice and support for pesticides users, to reduce their impacts on human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nWe are also taking action alongside many partners to implement the National Pollinator Strategy\u2019s provisions to help wild and managed pollinators to thrive. The Strategy sets out actions to address key risks and pressures, such as: habitat loss and fragmentation; invasive species; pests and disease; and climate change. This includes supporting IPM by restoring and creating habitats in rural and urban areas, including parks and gardens, and raising awareness across society so that people can take action themselves, by carefully considering whether or not to use pesticides in gardens, parks and other urban areas.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, our Environment Bill sets a new legal foundation for Government action to improve the environment. For example, it introduces Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs) to underpin the development of the Nature Recovery Network (NRN), an expanded and better-connected network of places that are richer in wildlife, more resilient to climate change and provide a range of benefits for people. LNRSs and the NRN Delivery Partnership, led by Natural England, will help bring people and organisations together at local and national levels to identify priorities and opportunities for nature recovery. We are integrating the goals for the network into a wide range of funding streams, including: land management schemes that reward environmental benefits; biodiversity net gain; and the Nature for Climate Fund.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-08-20T13:07:15.911Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-20T13:07:15.911Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 317343, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/317343.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Rebuild the economy out of lockdown with a Green New Deal", "background": "In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Government has intervened in the economy in an unprecedented way.\r\n\r\nThe recovery must not simply reinstate 'business as usual' \u2013 Parliament must introduce a radical 10-year strategy for public investment to decarbonise the economy and eradicate inequality.", "additional_details": "UK Parliament declared a Climate Emergency on 1 May 2019, but our emissions reduction efforts have so far fallen dangerously short.\r\n\r\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted both the power of Government to make rapid changes to protect people, and the extreme costs of delay.\r\n\r\nThe economic lockdown, while painful for so many, has resulted in a significant cut in emissions.\r\n\r\nWe must rebuild from the Coronavirus tragedy with the economic and social renewal mapped out by the cross-party Green New Deal Bill.", "committee_note": "", "state": "closed", "signature_count": 27768, "created_at": "2020-04-19T13:52:44.497Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-29T09:44:28.000Z", "rejected_at": null, "opened_at": "2020-06-15T07:27:35.407Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-15T23:59:59.999Z", "moderation_threshold_reached_at": "2020-04-19T16:47:14.000Z", "response_threshold_reached_at": "2020-06-25T22:53:24.000Z", "government_response_at": "2020-07-23T14:41:36.790Z", "debate_threshold_reached_at": null, "scheduled_debate_date": null, "debate_outcome_at": null, "creator_name": null, "rejection": null, "government_response": {"responded_on": "2020-07-21", "summary": "The Government is committed to a green, resilient recovery from COVID-19 and has already made announcements to demonstrate this commitment including a \u00a33bn investment in building energy efficiency.", "details": "The UK has led the world in tackling climate change \u2013 since 1990, we have cut emissions by 43% while growing the economy by 75%, we were the first major economy to set a net zero target in legislation, and will host the crucial COP26 talks in November 2021.\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister set out in his speech on 30 June, the Government intends to build back better, build back greener, and build back faster \u2013 enabling us to deliver a UK economy which is greener, more sustainable, and more resilient.

National planning policy sets a clear presumption away from developing high-quality agricultural land where possible.", "details": "This Government has committed to broadly maintaining current levels of food production in the Food Strategy, to ensure our continued high levels of food security. Our high degree of food security is built on supply from diverse sources; strong domestic production as well as imports through stable trade routes. We produce 60% of all the food we need, and 74% of food which we can grow or rear in the UK for all or part of the year, and these figures have changed little over the last 20 years.\r\n\r\nThere will always be multiple pressures on our land which require individual landowners, managers and Government to make decisions about trade-offs. Striking the right balance between different land uses is an important task which DEFRA and DLUHC have been working closely on. The National Planning Policy Framework aims to protect the best and most versatile agricultural land from significant, inappropriate or unsustainable development proposals, recognising the economic and other benefits of this land. It sets out a clear presumption away from the use of high-quality agricultural land for development where possible.\r\n\r\nHaving an effective, up-to-date plan in place is essential to planning for and meeting housing requirements in ways that make good use of land and result in well-designed and attractive places to live. The Government expects local authorities to work together to plan for and deliver the homes and infrastructure our communities need. We are committed to making the most of brownfield land and existing policy for protecting greenfield remains firmly in place.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that there is not a direct correlation between the amount of land farmed and productivity. Around 60% of the food we produce comes from just 30% of farmed land, and some sectors do not necessarily need much land in order to expand the amount they are able to produce. It is possible to maintain our food production by harnessing new technologies and innovation, and taking advantage of opportunities to grow and eat more of our own food, while seeing some land use change in some other areas. We will be investing \u00a3270 million across farming innovation funding programmes until 2029, to unlock technologies to drive sustainable farming techniques which will help increase productivity and profitability and the sector\u2019s long-term resilience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep this closely under review. Recognising the importance of food security, in the Agriculture Act 2020 the Government made a commitment to produce an assessment of our food security at least once every three years. The first UK Food Security Report was published in December 2021. The report recognises the contribution made by British agriculture to our resilience, and the importance of strong domestic production to our food security. It considers the UK's food supply sources overall, noting that domestic production and diversity of supply are both important to our food security.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2022-08-05T15:13:52.970Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-05T15:13:52.970Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 590080, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/590080.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Add Poland to the green list for international travel", "background": "COVID-19 cases in Poland are lower than for many other countries, but people arriving in England from Poland still have to go for quarantine for 10 days.

The Framework expects local authorities to not only protect landscapes, soils and sites of biodiversity but go further by enhancing these valued surroundings. The Framework also outlines that the character and beauty of the countryside, including trees and woodland, should be recognised in the planning of future development.  Strong protections are in place for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated land. The Government will continue to apply policy and law as appropriate to prevent harm to wildlife-rich habitat, and to restrict development in open countryside.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to making the most of brownfield land.  The Framework strongly encourages regeneration and re-use of brownfield, especially for housing - helping to level up communities across the country while taking off some of the pressure to consider other land, such as Green Belt, for new homes. The Framework expects local authorities to give substantial weight to re-using suitable brownfield when Plan-making or deciding planning applications.

Rightly, planning decisions are not made on the basis of the number of objectors or supporters. Instead, each local authority is responsible for preparing a vision for future development in its area using a Local Plan. The Local Plan outlines how land should be used and takes account of any necessary restraints on development. The Plan is created in consultation with the local community, and submitted for rigorous independent examination by a planning inspector. If the Plan is judged to be properly prepared, justified, and consistent with national policy in the Framework, it can come into effect. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that to help make home ownership affordable for more people, and help more people rent their own home, we need to deliver more homes. To get enough homes built in the places where people and communities need them, a crucial first step is to plan for the right number of homes. Local housing need introduced in 2018 is a measure of an area\u2019s housing need, against which councils must then consider their local circumstances and supply pipeline. Local authorities draw up a local housing target, taking into account factors including land availability and environmental constraints such as Green Belt. Following consultation to changes to the method (from August to October 2020) on 16 December 2020 we changed the formula to increase need in the 20 most populated urban areas. \r\n\r\nProtecting the Green Belt remains a priority and our national planning policy reinforces regenerating previously developed land, known as brownfield sites, and prioritising urban areas. The uplift in local housing needed within our biggest cities and urban centres in England will direct homes to where they are better served by infrastructure, and therefore protect our countryside. It also supports our wider objectives of regenerating brownfield sites, renewal, and levelling up. Green Belt decisions as outlined above will remain with local authorities and communities, ensuring they have influence over development, location and design.\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to apply strong policies to limit harm to Green Belt and the countryside, this Government is encouraging local authorities to make the most of their brownfield land. We are providing extensive financial support for this.  For example, in 2020 the Prime Minister announced that seven Mayoral Combined Authorities would receive a share of the \u00a3400 million Brownfield Housing Fund. This will help unlock 26,000 homes across England by bringing under-utilised brownfield land back into use. In addition we are investing \u00a375 million in a Brownfield Land Release Fund for authorities not eligible for the Brownfield Housing Fund. This is new capital funding to accelerate release of local authority-owned land for housing. The Brownfield Land Release Fund is expected to release land for 7,000 homes by 2024.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government", "created_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 587383, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/587383.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Add Bulgaria to the green list", "background": "Review and add Bulgaria to the green travel list to allow travel without quarantine on the return to the UK", "additional_details": "Travel is currently not cost effective for those of us with second homes in Bulgaria.", "committee_note": null, "state": "closed", "signature_count": 7760, "created_at": "2021-05-27T15:05:25.781Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-03T00:00:03.404Z", "rejected_at": null, "opened_at": "2021-06-02T09:30:41.609Z", "closed_at": "2021-12-02T23:59:59.999Z", "moderation_threshold_reached_at": "2021-05-27T15:32:25.000Z", "response_threshold_reached_at": null, "government_response_at": null, "debate_threshold_reached_at": null, "scheduled_debate_date": null, "debate_outcome_at": null, "creator_name": null, "rejection": null, "government_response": null, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 553305, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/553305.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "To make it a law that all schools need bollards outside for child safety", "background": "I want to start a petition for the government to make a law stating that every school in the country has to have a line of bollards outside their school.
