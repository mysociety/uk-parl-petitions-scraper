The Committee asked for evidence on the balance and effectiveness of existing legislation, the role and safety of public and private displays, and the needs of particular groups (such as veterans and people with disabilities), and animals. They received written and oral evidence representing a range of stakeholders, including from members of the public, representative bodies, organisations and charities, all with varying views on fireworks.\r\n\r\nThe Committee\u2019s final report, published on 5 November 2019, concluded that they could not support a ban on the public buying and using fireworks. Their reasoning for no further legislative action was:\r\n\r\nThe likely effects on community groups and their local fundraising efforts;\r\n\r\nThe concerns about ineffectiveness of a ban and resulting unintended and counter-productive consequences for public safety;\r\n\r\nThe substantial economic effect a ban would have, in particular, on those who have built their livelihoods on the fireworks industry.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the conclusion of the Petitions Committee. In the Government\u2019s response to the Committee, we also agreed that a ban could have the unintended consequence of pushing the market underground, driving individuals to source fireworks from illegitimate or unsafe suppliers. A ban could also prove detrimental to communities for cultural or financial reasons.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Government has committed to take further action to promote the safe and considerate use of fireworks and our actions will include:\r\n\r\nDeveloping a public awareness campaign on the safe use of fireworks; \r\n\r\nEngaging with animal charities to further discuss their work related to animal welfare issues; \r\n\r\nEngaging with Local Authorities to understand the issues they face with regard to fireworks; \r\n\r\nEngaging with the fireworks industry to discuss any additional action they might take to address the concerns raised around fireworks packaging appealing to underage individuals.\r\n\r\nThese actions show that the Government has been listening to the concerns that have been raised about fireworks and that work is continuing.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "created_at": "2020-08-13T14:23:15.764Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-13T14:23:15.764Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-11-08", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-11-08/debates/E3C6762B-B81D-462E-95C1-6EAA2030A63E/FireworksSaleAndUse", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN-o7RyDzZw", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2021-0183/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "BEIS", "name": "Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 574678, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/574678.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Introduce charges on carbon emissions to tackle climate crisis and air pollution", "background": "Air pollution kills 64,000 people in the UK every year, yet the Government provides annual fossil fuel subsidies of \u00a310.5 billion, according to the European Commission.

This will be the world\u2019s first net zero cap and trade market, delivering a robust carbon price signal and promoting cost-effective decarbonisation by allowing businesses to cut carbon where it is cheapest to do so. \r\n\r\nThe UK ETS covers emissions from power generation, energy intensive industries and aviation. Alongside this, the Carbon Price Support rate on fossil fuels used in electricity generation will ensure that a strong decarbonisation signal is maintained to ensure a downwards trajectory in power sector emissions as we push to fully drive out coal.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 Energy White Paper committed to exploring expanding the UK ETS to the two thirds of emissions not currently covered by the UK ETS, and set out our aspirations to continue to lead the world on carbon pricing in the run up to COP26 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government is also determined to tackle air pollution given its significant negative impact on public health, the economy and the environment. Air quality has improved significantly over recent decades thanks to the action we have already taken. \r\n\r\nThe Government continues to take action to reduce emissions and improve air quality through the vehicle tax system. Users of zero and ultra-low emission vehicles have beneficial Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and company car tax (CCT) rates in comparison to conventionally fuelled vehicles. To improve air quality, new diesel models that do not meet the Real Driving Emissions 2 (RDE2) standard for nitrogen oxide emissions have also gone up by one VED band on first registration and the CCT supplement for diesel cars that do not meet the latest RDE2 standard has increased from 3 to 4%. \r\n\r\nTo tackle climate change and improve air quality the Government will also be removing the entitlement to use red diesel from most sectors from April 2022. This means that most businesses using diesel across the UK will need to use fuel taxed at the standard rate for diesel, which more fairly reflects the harmful impact of the emissions they produce.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission\u2019s figure of \u20ac10.5bn for UK subsidies to fossil fuels comes from the report \u201cEnergy prices and costs in Europe\u201d which uses OECD inventory methodology as a basis for its findings. This is a broader concept of support than that of the International Energy Agency, which the UK follows. It references a broader range of support measures, including many that do not reduce consumer prices below world market levels. Such mechanisms are classified as support without reference to the purpose for which they were first put in place or their economic or environmental effects. The OECD is clear that they therefore make no judgement as to whether or not such measures are inefficient or ought to be reformed.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the UK does not give any subsidies to fossil fuels and is a longstanding supporter of multilateral efforts to promote fossil fuel subsidy reform since these were first proposed in 2009, including through the G20, & the G7. We support the G20 commitment to rationalise and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies across the globe and see clear benefits in doing so.\r\n\r\nIn June 2019, the UK became the first major economy to legislate to end our net contribution to climate change by 2050. The government also accepted the Committee for Climate Change\u2019s recommendation that the Treasury should undertake a review into the costs of transitioning to Net Zero. The Interim Report, published in December 2020, is the first publication from the Treasury\u2019s Net Zero Review. It is a discussion document that sets out the analysis so far and seeks feedback ahead of the Final Report, due in spring 2021. The Final Report will take this analysis further, focusing on innovation and growth, competitiveness, household impacts, and embedding the findings.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury\r\n", "created_at": "2021-04-01T16:56:58.611Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-01T16:56:58.611Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-11-01", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-11-01/debates/F2982AB2-6D9F-4D5B-8720-D4EC7F36CDF8/CarbonEmissionCharges", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdhBpY_3NNI", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2021-0177/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "HMT", "name": "HM Treasury", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 585520, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/585520.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the sale of artificial grass", "background": "It is environmentally irresponsible to allow garden space occupied by grass & other plant life (which processes CO2 & supports wildlife) to be replaced by plastic which does not biodegrade.", "additional_details": "Natural Grass & Plants encourage a healthy ecosystem, capturing CO2.\r\n \r\nBanning the sale of artificial grass could be a small step towards increasing the UK biodiversity, reducing our carbon footprint & helping our ever dwindling insect & wildlife population.

This response is relevant to England.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out our ambition to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste. We are making great strides to tackle plastic pollution. The Government\u2019s Resources and Waste Strategy for England, published in 2018, outlines the ways in which we will meet this ambition by taking action across each stage of the product lifecycle as we move towards a more circular economy:\r\nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nWe know more needs to be done and for the most problematic plastics we are going faster. This is why we have committed to work towards all plastic packaging on the market being recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. \r\n\r\nWe prefer to help people and companies make the right choice, rather than banning items outright. However, where progress is insufficient, we will explore alternative policy measures, which may involve bans as part of a wider strategic approach. For instance, in 2018, the Government introduced a ban on microbeads in rinse-off personal care products and in October 2020, we introduced restrictions on the supply of plastic straws, stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have reduced the use of single-use carrier bags by the main supermarket retailers by 95% with our 5p charge. To build on the success of this charge, we have now increased it to 10p and extended it to all retailers. We will continue to review the latest evidence on problematic products and/ or materials to take a systematic approach to reducing the use of unnecessary single-use plastic products.\r\n\r\nIt is for local authorities to comply with the legal and policy safeguards in place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage. The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (the NERC Act) requires all public authorities in England to have regard for conserving biodiversity in the exercise of their functions. Our most important designated sites and species are also protected under legislation. \r\n\r\nThe Government is introducing new requirements to maintain and enhance the natural environment in England. We are mandating biodiversity net gain in our landmark Environment Bill to ensure that new developments enhance habitats for biodiversity. Surfaces such as artificial grass are of no value to wildlife, so any developer or local authority seeking to demonstrate biodiversity net gain would be incentivised to avoid the use of such surfaces in their developments\u2019 shared green spaces. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Environment Bill strengthens the current NERC Act biodiversity duty on public authorities to require them to take action to conserve and enhance biodiversity; and introduces a reporting requirement for those public authorities with the greatest potential to enhance biodiversity. This will further incentivise public authorities to adopt approaches that improve the environment. We will also develop guidance to help local planning authorities identify actions they can take to comply with the strengthened duty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government has no plans to ban the use of artificial grass. We prefer to help people and organisations make the right choice rather than legislating on such matters. However, the use of artificial grass must comply with the legal and policy safeguards in place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage, while measures such as the strengthened biodiversity duty should serve to encourage public authorities to consider more sustainable alternatives.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-06-08T12:56:13.492Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-08T12:56:13.492Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 552306, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/552306.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Remove guidance and funding for temporary traffic measures that cause congestion", "background": "Road closures, \u2018school streets\u2019 and new cycle lanes are creating severe congestion, long traffic delays and severe frustration across the country.

We know the majority of people support giving more road space to cycling and walking in their local area.", "details": "Local authorities have a duty to manage their roads for the benefit of all traffic, including cyclists and pedestrians. The more people that cycle and walk, the more road space is freed up for those who really need to drive. Encouraging more cycling and walking is a key part of the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce harmful emissions from transport, as well as to help make people healthier.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Active Travel Fund (EATF) was announced on 9 May and included \u00a3225 million of funding for local authorities in England. The first tranche focused on temporary changes such as pop-up cycle lanes and widened pavements, to enable social distancing and encourage active travel while public transport capacity is constrained. \r\n\r\nAlongside the funding, the Government published additional Network Management Duty guidance. This clearly set out what the Government expects of local authorities in making changes to their road layouts to encourage cycling and walking to support a green recovery. Low-traffic neighbourhoods, school streets, and cycle facilities are some of the measures listed. It is available at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities. \r\n\r\nLow-traffic neighbourhoods are a collection of measures, including road closures to motor traffic, designed to remove rat-running traffic. They deliver a wide range of benefits \u2013 a safer and more pleasant environment for residents, more walking and cycling and better air quality. \r\n\r\nSchool streets are part-time access restrictions that operate during school pick-up and drop-off times, during term time only. Access is maintained for residents, businesses and others such as Blue Badge holders. They can reduce the number of people driving their children to school by up to a third.\r\n\r\nThere are often concerns that reallocating road space will have a negative impact on business. However, evidence shows that people who walk and cycle take more trips to the high street over the course of a month than people who drive. Making access to high streets easier by walking and cycling has a proven economic benefit. Well planned improvements in the walking environment can deliver up to a 40% increase in shopping footfall and high street walking, cycling and public realm improvements can increase retail sales by up to 30%.\r\n\r\nEvidence also shows that investment in cycling and walking is supported by the majority of people in local communities. Although some schemes have attracted negative attention, this is still only a small minority of the people living in those areas. \r\n\r\nLocal authorities are responsible for delivering cycling and walking schemes in their areas. Although central Government cannot intervene in local democratic decisions, our position remains that if councils fail to demonstrate that their plans are genuine improvements then we will not hesitate to withhold funding. Many measures in tranche 1 of the EATF had to be installed quickly, and local authorities should be willing to consider making changes to these in the light of experience, as some already have. \r\n\r\nEffective engagement with the local community, particularly at an early stage, is essential to ensuring the political and public acceptance of any scheme. We are clear that in implementing any of these measures, local authorities will need to ensure access for Blue Badge holders, deliveries and other essential services as appropriate. They will also need to be mindful of the requirements of equalities legislation, ensuring, for example, that in redesigning and reallocating road space they take careful account of the impact this may have on disabled people. \r\n\r\nMany schemes have been installed as trials. This approach can help achieve change and ensure a permanent scheme is right first time, but schemes will take time to bed in and for the benefits to become apparent. Trials still require consultation, which is carried out alongside the implementation so that changes can be made in response to feedback. \r\n\r\nSome measures, such as road closures, require Traffic Regulation Orders to give effect to them. The temporary amendments made in May to the process for making these orders did not change any of the notice periods. More information on this is available at  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-traffic-regulation-orders-during-coronavirus-covid-19.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities must consult with the emergency services to ensure access is maintained. They have been generally supportive of low-traffic neighbourhoods, and in some cases, their access has improved because narrow, unsuitable roads are no longer full of traffic.\r\n\r\nDifferent types of intervention will be appropriate in different places. For example, what works in urban areas may not be suitable in rural areas or smaller towns, where people are more reliant on private vehicles. Schemes must balance the needs of cyclists and pedestrians with the needs of other road users, including motorists and local businesses.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2020-10-27T16:05:06.059Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-27T17:25:59.255Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 549607, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/549607.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "The Government to fund either a new bridge or repairs for Hammersmith bridge", "background": "Hammersmith bridge is now shut to pedestrians as well as vehicles and cyclists it\u2019s impacting on many lives.

The Government is committed to recognising the importance of trees \u2013 young and old - by delivering programmes and policies which bring the benefits of trees into all of our lives. We therefore recently launched a consultation on the England Tree Strategy. This includes proposals to increase protections for our trees and woodlands, including through improving the criteria for applying Tree Preservation Orders. Such proposals would build on existing work to protect trees through regulations and the planning system. Responses are invited to that consultation, which can be accessed through GOV.UK:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-a-tree-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nIn the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) an ancient or veteran tree is defined as: \u2018A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value.\u2019 Ancient and veteran trees are irreplaceable habitats, which are of great importance for wildlife, cultural, economic and historic value. The Government is committed to ensuring ancient and veteran trees are adequately protected and suitably managed to provide a wide range of social, environmental and economic benefits to society. We therefore strengthened the protection of ancient and veteran trees through the NPPF and the supporting National Planning Practice Guidance. The NPPF now recognises ancient and veteran trees as irreplaceable habitats and aligns the planning system more closely with Defra\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan, which aims to leave the environment in a better state for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe Government has long recognised public concern over tree felling and any impacts on woodlands, including ancient woodlands. The Forestry Commission is responsible for the licensing of sustainable tree felling across England. In respect of ancient trees, its decisions are underpinned by the Keepers of Time policy (2005) and the ancient and native woodland practice guidelines. The Forestry Commission works hard to ensure that illegal felling is discouraged and illegally felled woodland is restocked, taking appropriate enforcement action when necessary. We are taking further measures through the Environment Bill to give the Forestry Commission more powers to tackle illegal tree felling, further strengthening the protection of all wooded landscapes, including ancient trees. We are also using the Environment Bill to improve protection of our existing urban trees, by introducing a new duty on local highway authorities, to ensure they consult the public when considering felling urban street trees. This will ensure that the views of the public are considered in the management of these important assets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, as part of our current consultation on the England Tree Strategy, we are considering whether changes need to be made to the Tree Preservation Order criteria to improve protection for trees. Tightening the current criteria could improve consistency in the application of the policy and provide the opportunity to include more relevant factors to the environment, such as carbon sequestration. Feedback from stakeholders has shown us that Tree Preservation Orders are valued as a way to protect trees, but work is needed to bring the system up-to-date and ensure they are applied and enforced with consistency. Greater clarification of the criteria for making a Tree Preservation Order, including consideration of ecosystem service values, would be helpful. We would welcome views on this as part of the consultation.\r\n\r\nAncient trees provide valuable ecosystems services and are a living link to our society\u2019s social and economic history. Existing, proportionate regulations balance this inherent value with local accountability and national interest. With this suite of existing regulations and protections, ancient trees are well-protected and we therefore do not believe that further legal rights are necessary.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.
