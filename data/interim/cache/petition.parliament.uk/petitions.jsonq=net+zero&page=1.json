This railway will play a vital role in delivering the Government\u2019s carbon net zero objectives.", "details": "The Government has carefully considered the merits and disadvantages of proceeding with HS2 and has firmly concluded that it should go ahead. HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, and help to rebalance opportunity fairly across the country. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.  During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history. \r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament. The Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable. Just this month, Andrew Stephenson MP, the dedicated HS2 minister, went before the Transport Select Committee to discuss HS2 in depth, and a record of this hearing can be found on Parliament.UK. \r\n\r\nMinisters have made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. \r\n\r\nWe are continuing work on managing the full impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on delivery of the HS2 programme. We intend to update Parliament on the latest position as part of the next six-monthly Parliamentary Report, expected in Spring 2021. \r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. The environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One. Alongside the Act, the Government also published a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project. \r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. Phase One expects to support 33 square kilometres of wildlife habitat - an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations. \r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nSecuring the land and property needed to construct the line of route across all Phases is vital to the programme\u2019s success and is often the first impact that we have on line of route communities. A range of statutory and non-statutory property compensation schemes are available that seek to compensate affected parties fairly while protecting the public purse.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to provide fair compensation for those directly and indirectly impacted but the process and disputes for claims can inevitably be traumatic for some. Andrew Stephenson commissioned a detailed review of the acquisition and compensation process to ensure that there is a renewed focus on those who are being impacted by the new railway. The report contained 36 recommendations which are actively being implemented which will see rapid improvements for local communities. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to repeal any legislation relating to the development and delivery of HS2.  However, we will continue to welcome further public and parliamentary scrutiny of the project. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-09-13", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-09-13/debates/3614AE85-A25C-4874-9DAE-9802247DFDDF/HS2", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yt-9ZsO5vg", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9313/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 599602, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/599602.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Hold a referendum on whether to keep the 2050 net zero target", "background": "Set a referendum on whether the UK should continue with its 2050 net zero target.", "additional_details": "I believe net zero target lacks legitimacy and without a referendum the current climate change policy lacks the explicit consent of the people, as argued by The Harrogate Agenda.

It was one of the top six pledges in the government\u2019s manifesto, alongside policy commitments to help achieve the target. The net zero target was passed into law by Parliament with strong cross-Party support.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that public concern about climate change is high, having doubled since 2016, with 80% of people in the UK either concerned or very concerned (BEIS Public Attitudes Tracker Wave 37, 2021). We also know that people and businesses recognise that change must happen - 80% of respondents in a recent survey believe the way we live our lives will need to change to address climate change (BEIS, Climate change and net zero: public awareness and perceptions, 2021). In the same survey, after being provided with information on net zero, 78% of all participants said they strongly or somewhat supported the net zero target. \r\nMoving away from fossil fuels and towards net zero gives us the unprecedented opportunity to:\r\n\r\n - Create and secure thousands of well-paid, quality jobs across the UK, helping to level up the country. Tackling net zero will create thousands long-term jobs in our reindustrialised heartlands.\r\n\r\n - Build a more secure, home-grown energy sector based on nuclear, wind, hydrogen and solar that is not reliant on imported fossil fuels, providing consumers with affordable, reliable energy for warmer homes and workplaces.\r\n\r\n - Reduce harmful pollution which contaminates our air and our natural environment to improve our health and wellbeing, as well as that of future generations.\r\n\r\n - Attract investment into UK businesses and industry, revitalising our industrial heartlands while driving down the costs of key technologies \u2013 from electric vehicles to heat pumps \u2013 to reduce bills and give the UK a competitive edge. Since the launch of the Prime Minister\u2019s Ten Point Plan we have secured \u00a35.8bn in green foreign investment.\r\n\r\nRecent volatile international gas prices have demonstrated that we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. We need to protect consumers and businesses from global gas prices by increasing our domestic energy security through clean power that is generated in the UK for the people of the UK.\r\n\r\nTaking action on climate is also crucial to strengthening the UK\u2019s place in the global economy as we Build Back Better from the pandemic.

We set out in our Resources and Waste Strategy (2018) that we are committed to moving towards a more circular economy. That means we will continue to prioritise measures to prevent waste occurring in the first place, but where waste does occur, we should be maximising its resource value and minimising its environmental impact.\r\n\r\nWe consulted on a new Waste Prevention Programme between March and June 2021 which builds on the Resources and Waste Strategy and seeks to establish a programme which helps with our strategic goals including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net zero, as well as increasing our resource productivity and minimising waste. Subject to the results of that consultation, it will propose action across seven key sectors \u2013 construction; textiles; furniture; electrical and electronics products; road vehicles; packaging, plastics and single-use items; and food \u2013 to minimise waste and work towards a more resource efficient economy. This includes steps to use resources more efficiently, design and manufacture products for optimum life and repair and reuse more items. We expect to publish our revised Programme following the consultation shortly.\r\n\r\nAll local authorities and waste operators are already required, under the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 on the transfer of waste, to collect, treat and dispose of waste in accordance with the waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste management options.\u202fThis requires the prevention of waste in the first place (such as reuse or reduction of materials), and where this is not possible, preparing items for reuse. If neither prevention nor preparing for re-use is possible, then recycling is the next best option, followed by energy recovery (such as energy from waste). Disposal without energy recovery, such as landfill, is regarded as the worst option. Subject to some limited exceptions, regulation 13 requires the separate collection of waste paper, metal, plastic and glass and regulation 14 requires that separately collected waste is not mixed with other material with different properties. Following this, in 2020 we introduced a ban on sending waste paper, metal, plastic and glass that is separately collected for recycling or preparing for re-use to landfill or incineration.\t\r\n\r\nWhen waste cannot be prevented or reused, the waste hierarchy states that it should be recycled where possible. The Environment Act 2021 inserts new requirements into the Environmental Protection Act 1990 for all local authorities in England to make arrangements for a core set of materials (paper and card; glass; metal; plastic; food waste; and garden waste) to be collected separately for recycling from households. These include requirements on businesses and non-domestic premises, such as schools and hospitals, to present the same waste streams for separate collection, except garden waste, and arrange for their separate collection.\r\n\r\nWe recently consulted on measures to increase the consistency in recycling in line with the new provisions in the Environmental Protection Act. This will ensure that there is more recycled material in the products we\u202fbuy,\u202fand\u202fthat\u202fthe UK recycling industry\u202fgrows. Whilst we want to introduce consistency in recycling as quickly as possible, we recognise local authorities and businesses will need time to adapt to the changes. We expect to publish a full Government response to our consultation in early 2022 and intend to consult further on statutory guidance in 2022.\r\n\r\nThese measures will constitute a significant step towards meeting our 25 Year Environment Plan commitment to eliminate avoidable waste by 2050 and\u202fcontribute towards meeting\u202frecycling targets, including our commitment of 65% of municipal (household-like) waste to be recycled by 2035, with no more than 10% ending up in landfill.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the impact of the landfill tax on the percentage of waste sent to landfill. In England, 8.5% of local authority managed waste went to landfill in 2019/20. By continuing to incentivise the diversion of waste away from landfill to be managed further up the waste hierarchy through the Landfill Tax, the Government is making strong progress towards the goal of no more than 10% of municipal waste to landfill by 2035.\r\n\r\nThe planned introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and a Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) will also help incentivise recycling of plastic and metal. More details will be communicated in the Government responses to the public consultations for EPR and DRS which were held in 2021. These responses will be published in early 2022.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n", "created_at": "2021-12-31T14:06:20.734Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-31T14:06:20.734Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 617573, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/617573.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Require all new builds to have solar panels as condition of planning permission", "background": "Make it mandatory for all new buildings to be fitted with solar panels as a condition of planning permission.

The Building Regulations set standards for the design, construction and alteration of buildings, which means they are an important mechanism for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. The Regulations are technology-neutral and therefore do not ban or mandate specific technologies. This provides developers with flexibility to innovate and choose the most appropriate and cost-effective solutions for their site. For instance, some homes may not be suitable for solar panels due to reasons such as shading, orientation, and roof size/shape.\r\n \r\nWe recognise, however, the important role that rooftop solar panels can play in making buildings more energy efficient. We must therefore take the opportunity, where appropriate, to fit solar panels.\r\n\r\nIn December 2021 the Government introduced an uplift in energy efficiency standards, which came into force in June 2022. The uplift delivers a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions, with new homes now expected to produce around 30% less CO2 emissions and new non-domestic buildings expected to produce around 27% less CO2 emissions compared to those built to the previous standards. We expect that to meet the new standards, most new homes and buildings will be built with solar panels. Where they do not include solar panels, they are likely to include other low carbon heating technology, such as heat pumps. \r\n\r\nThe uplift is a stepping-stone towards the 2025 Future Homes and Buildings Standards, which will deliver even higher energy efficiency standards. From 2025, new homes and buildings will be \u2018zero carbon ready\u2019, which means that no further retrofit work for energy efficiency will be necessary to enable them to become zero-carbon as the electricity grid continues to decarbonise. We expect heat pumps will become the primary heating technology for new buildings under the Future Homes and Buildings Standards. Other green technologies, such as solar panels, will also continue to play an important role. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the planning framework, our National Planning Policy Framework sets out policies that encourage local planning authorities to consider the use and supply of renewable and low carbon energy and heat through plan making and when determining planning applications.\r\n \r\nThere are a range of nationally set permitted development rights that allow for the installation of micro-generation equipment, including rooftop solar panels on domestic and non-domestic properties, without having to make a planning application.
