Gurkha pensions are different, but these differences are objectively and reasonably justified and suited to the circumstances of the time. The legal basis for Gurkha pensions has been upheld by three Judicial Reviews since 2003, including a case that went to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\r\n\r\nIt is a principle of all public sector pensions policy that improvements to pension schemes are not made retrospective. Since 2007 Gurkhas have served on the same basis as the remainder of the British Army apart from specific conditions to maintain the Brigade of Gurkhas. All serving Gurkhas on, and those who retired after, 1 July 1997 were given the option to transfer to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). The 1 July 1997 date is significant because that is when Gurkhas ceased to be a Far East based force and became based in the UK.\r\n\r\nFor most Gurkha veterans the GPS, which closed in 2007, provides a pension at least as good as, and in many cases better than, that given to their British counterparts with identical periods of service. Under the GPS Gurkhas qualified for an immediate pension after 15 years\u2019 service, typically in their early 30s, whereas most British personnel on the AFPS did not serve for the 22 years necessary to qualify for an immediate pension, and instead have a preserved pension payable at the age of 60, or age 65 for service after 2006. This means typically Gurkhas will have been receiving pension payments for over 25 years before most British soldiers of the same rank and length of service qualify for any payments under the AFPS.\r\n\r\nThe GPS differs from other pension schemes but provides a positive standard of living in Nepal and is objectively fair and justified, as upheld by three Judicial Reviews since 2003, including a case that went to the ECHR. The ECHR judgement, which contains further background information, is published here:\r\nhttps://www.army.mod.uk/media/6211/european-court-ruling-gurkha-pensions.pdf\r\n\r\nWe are conscious that there are grievances held by some Gurkha veterans, but the Government does not accept that Gurkha pensions are unfair. Together with Nepali Embassy officials we have continuously engaged in dialogue with Gurkha veterans\u2019 groups, giving them the opportunity to articulate their grievances.\r\n\r\nThe former Minister for the Armed Forces met repeatedly with Nepali Ministers and veterans groups to discuss those issues on which some veterans are still campaigning. This led to the production of the Technical Report in which Gurkha veterans\u2019 grievances together with the UK government\u2019s responses were articulated in one document (the Report of the Technical Committee on Gurkha Veterans) for the first time, which is available here:\r\nhttp://2ndgoorkhas.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180314-Final_Report_Gurkha_Technical_Committee_1a1.pdf\r\n\r\nIn March 2019, following lengthy dialogue and the production of the Report, ministers announced increases to pensions under the Gurkha Pension Scheme (GPS) of between 10% and 34% above the annual inflation rise, and a new \u00a325m investment in medical and healthcare facilities in Nepal for Gurkha veterans. That announcement is available here:\r\nhttps://www.army.mod.uk/news-and-events/news/2019/03/enhanced-package-of-support-for-gurkha-veterans/\r\n\r\nThe matter was also discussed between the Prime Ministers of the UK and Nepal in June 2019, when it was confirmed that the pension arrangements raised in the dialogue with Gurkha veterans and the Government of Nepal would not be re-opened.\r\n\r\nThe government agreed to reconsider the decision on the increase to pensions made in 2019 and a public consultation sought views on how changes should be implemented for the GPS. That consultation closed earlier this year and after considering responses, ministers will make a fresh decision on the size of the uplift. A summary of responses to the consultation and the Government\u2019s decision will be published on the Government website in due course.

GDP is closely correlated with employment, incomes and tax receipts and is comparable across time periods, making it useful for the government and Bank of England when setting economic policy and managing the public finances. During the current COVID-19 pandemic for example, GDP, along with a wide range of other economic indicators, has been used to inform government action aimed at mitigating the damaging effects of the pandemic on peoples\u2019 wellbeing by supporting their jobs and livelihoods.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the government recognises that GDP has its limitations and should not be seen as an all-encompassing measure of welfare \u2013 in fact this is something that GDP was never designed to be. \r\n\r\nSir Charles Bean\u2019s 2016 Independent Review of Economic Statistics acknowledged some of GDP\u2019s limitations, such as the challenge of capturing activities where no market transaction takes place and the fact that GDP estimates make no allowance for the depletion of natural resources that may be inherent in many forms of economic production. The full report can be found here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507081/2904936_Bean_Review_Web_Accessible.pdf \r\n\r\nThe government fully supported the recommendations of the Bean review and, to date, has provided the ONS with an additional \u00a325m to help improve UK economic statistics - including through an initiative called \u201cBeyond GDP\u201d that aims to address the limitations in GDP by developing broader measures of welfare and activity. \r\n\r\nThis includes developing a suite of personal well-being measures, better accounting for unpaid work and developing estimates for natural and human capital. More information on this initiative can be found here. https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2018/10/01/beyond-gdp-how-ons-is-developing-wider-measures-of-the-uk-economy/  \r\n\r\nAs a result of this work, last year the UK became one of the first countries to publish natural capital accounts and these are now included in the UK National Accounts Blue Book. The ONS has also started to publish human capital accounts. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, recognising that protecting and enhancing our natural assets is crucial to achieving a sustainable, resilient economy, at Spring Statement 2019 the government commissioned an independent, global review on the economics of biodiversity. The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review was published in February and represents a strong example of UK thought-leadership on an important environmental issue with clear \u2013 but often overlooked \u2013 economic consequences. The government is currently examining the Review\u2019s findings \u2013 including the options it sets out relating to improving measures of economic success to account for the goods and services derived from the natural environment \u2013 and will respond formally in due course.\r\n\r\nAs well as considering the metrics used to inform decision making, the government is also taking action directly to protect and enhance the natural world. For example, the recent Spending Review settlement increased Defra\u2019s budgets by almost \u00a31 billion. This will allow them to do more to harness the power of nature in the fight against climate change - and connect people with green spaces - by planting trees, restoring peatland, creating habitats, and investing in National Parks. This includes support to implement flagship Environment Bill measures including biodiversity net gain for development, new environmental targets, and the Office for Environmental Protection, which will provide annual independent reporting on the implementation of the government\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan, setting out what the government will do to improve the environment within a generation. The plan can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, as COP Presidency this year, the UK is seeking to increase global climate action and environmental protection. By doing so, we are working to ensure that the recovery from COVID-19 is both sustainable and equitable and to propel the long-term transition to a net zero, resilient and environmentally sustainable global economy.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury", "created_at": "2021-05-28T06:58:15.561Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-28T06:58:15.561Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "HMT", "name": "HM Treasury", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 303345, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/303345.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Pay self employed workers a wage due to lack of earnings caused by COVID-19.", "background": "For the government to have a debate and authorise a top up of wages for the self-employed during the coronavirus outbreak. \r\n\r\nRegardless if they are infected or not, less people are travelling and going to work on a daily basis creating a loss of income.", "additional_details": "For example, if somebody would usually make \u00a31kpw but only makes \u00a3400pw due to Covid-19 the government should arrange a cash payout.

Self-employed individuals, including members of partnerships, are eligible if they have submitted their Income Tax Self Assessment tax return for the tax year 2018-19, continued to trade and have lost trading/partnership trading profits due to COVID-19.

Parliament has already approved the move to a zero rate and included a provision in Finance Act 2016 allowing the change to come in to force as soon as the UK has discretion to do so under its legal obligations.  The Government will accordingly be able to apply the zero rate from the 1st January 2021, once the transition period has ended.  This was confirmed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the presentation of his March 2020 Budget.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the new zero rate is defined by the existing 5 per cent reduced rate applied to WSPs, which covers the supply of any sanitary protection product that is designed and marketed solely for the absorption or collection of menstrual flow or lochia.  This relief specifically excludes articles of clothing such as \u201cperiod pants\u201d.\r\n\r\nSuch exclusions are designed to ensure that the relief is properly targeted, since difficulties in policing the scope of the relief create the potential for litigation, erosion of the tax base and a reduction in revenue. However, \u201cperiod pants\u201d may qualify for the zero rate when designed for children under the age of 14 years old providing they meet certain maximum sizing limits.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Government regularly receives requests for reduced or zero rating on a wide range of products, VAT is designed as a broad tax on consumer expenditure, and reliefs from the standard rate have to be strictly limited.  As Budget 2020 acknowledged, VAT makes a significant contribution towards the public finances. VAT raised around \u00a3130 billion in 2019/20 and helps fund the Government's priorities including on health, schools, and defence.  Nevertheless, the application of VAT is kept under constant review.  Even though period pants may find they do not qualify, the new zero rate will ensure that every woman that needs sanitary protection during their monthly cycle will, from the start of January and for the first time, have access to a variety of zero rated products on which they had previously paid a 5 per cent rate of VAT.\r\n\r\nHM Tresuary\r\n", "created_at": "2020-09-29T13:14:58.831Z", "updated_at": "2020-09-29T13:14:58.831Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "HMT", "name": "HM Treasury", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 300050, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300050.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Legal rights for ancient trees", "background": "All ancient trees (over 100 years of age) to have the legal right not to be damaged or felled, with the exception of sustainable forestry to produce wood and maintaining the tree\u2019s health.

The Government is committed to recognising the importance of trees \u2013 young and old - by delivering programmes and policies which bring the benefits of trees into all of our lives. We therefore recently launched a consultation on the England Tree Strategy. This includes proposals to increase protections for our trees and woodlands, including through improving the criteria for applying Tree Preservation Orders. Such proposals would build on existing work to protect trees through regulations and the planning system. Responses are invited to that consultation, which can be accessed through GOV.UK:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-a-tree-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nIn the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) an ancient or veteran tree is defined as: \u2018A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value.\u2019 Ancient and veteran trees are irreplaceable habitats, which are of great importance for wildlife, cultural, economic and historic value. The Government is committed to ensuring ancient and veteran trees are adequately protected and suitably managed to provide a wide range of social, environmental and economic benefits to society. We therefore strengthened the protection of ancient and veteran trees through the NPPF and the supporting National Planning Practice Guidance. The NPPF now recognises ancient and veteran trees as irreplaceable habitats and aligns the planning system more closely with Defra\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan, which aims to leave the environment in a better state for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe Government has long recognised public concern over tree felling and any impacts on woodlands, including ancient woodlands. The Forestry Commission is responsible for the licensing of sustainable tree felling across England. In respect of ancient trees, its decisions are underpinned by the Keepers of Time policy (2005) and the ancient and native woodland practice guidelines. The Forestry Commission works hard to ensure that illegal felling is discouraged and illegally felled woodland is restocked, taking appropriate enforcement action when necessary. We are taking further measures through the Environment Bill to give the Forestry Commission more powers to tackle illegal tree felling, further strengthening the protection of all wooded landscapes, including ancient trees. We are also using the Environment Bill to improve protection of our existing urban trees, by introducing a new duty on local highway authorities, to ensure they consult the public when considering felling urban street trees. This will ensure that the views of the public are considered in the management of these important assets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, as part of our current consultation on the England Tree Strategy, we are considering whether changes need to be made to the Tree Preservation Order criteria to improve protection for trees. Tightening the current criteria could improve consistency in the application of the policy and provide the opportunity to include more relevant factors to the environment, such as carbon sequestration. Feedback from stakeholders has shown us that Tree Preservation Orders are valued as a way to protect trees, but work is needed to bring the system up-to-date and ensure they are applied and enforced with consistency. Greater clarification of the criteria for making a Tree Preservation Order, including consideration of ecosystem service values, would be helpful. We would welcome views on this as part of the consultation.\r\n\r\nAncient trees provide valuable ecosystems services and are a living link to our society\u2019s social and economic history. Existing, proportionate regulations balance this inherent value with local accountability and national interest. With this suite of existing regulations and protections, ancient trees are well-protected and we therefore do not believe that further legal rights are necessary.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

The woman should be advised to contact maternity services at any time if she has concerns about her baby\u2019s movements or notices reduced fetal movement (RFM) after 24 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to patient safety and eradicating avoidable harms.

The guidelines provide advice based on the available evidence, to guide clinicians to provide the best most appropriate care to women presenting with reduced fetal movement during pregnancy. \r\n\r\nAccording to the guidelines, when a woman reports reduced fetal movement, the priority is to confirm fetal viability. A handheld Doppler device will usually be used to confirm the presence of the fetal heartbeat. \r\n\r\nThis should be available in the majority of community settings in which a pregnant woman would be seen by a midwife or a general practitioner. The duration of recording is restricted to 20\u201330 minutes with the mother in a semi-recumbent position. There are no studies which have evaluated the use of longer periods of fetal movement counting by Doppler ultrasound or whether this method can detect fetuses at risk of stillbirth.\r\n\r\nAfter fetal viability has been confirmed, if the pregnancy is over 28+0 weeks of gestation, the woman should undergo cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring of the fetal heart rate initially for at least 20 minutes, to detect fetal compromise. An ultrasound scan assessment should be undertaken as part of the preliminary investigations of a woman presenting with RFM after 28+0 weeks of gestation if the perception of RFM persists despite a normal CTG or if there are any additional risk factors for fetal grown restriction and stillbirth. \r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have developed a consensus statement on \u201cElectronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM)\u201d.

The bundle comprises of four key elements which include reducing smoking in pregnancy; risk assessment and surveillance for fetal growth restriction; raising awareness of reduced fetal movement; and effective fetal monitoring during labour. \r\n\r\nThe four key elements are being implemented in all NHS maternity services. An independent evaluation of the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle showed that stillbirths fell by 20% at the maternity units where implementation of the Care Bundle was evaluated.  Version two of the Saving Babies\u2019 Lives Care Bundle (SBLCBv2) was launched in March 2019, to build on version one and to address the issues identified in the evaluation. \r\n\r\nThe care bundle sets out that an ultrasound scan for fetal growth, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler needs only to be offered on first presentation of RFM if there is no computerised CTG or if there is another indication for scan (e.g. the baby is \u2018Small for Gestational Age\u2019 on clinical assessment). Ultrasound scan for fetal growth, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler should be offered to women presenting with recurrent RFM after 28+0 weeks\u2019 gestation. \r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to work to develop policy and support initiatives to reduce stillbirths and provide better support and safer care for mothers and their babies.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care", "created_at": "2021-10-21T12:48:05.004Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-21T13:02:48.925Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DHSC", "name": "Department of Health and Social Care", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 614222, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/614222.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Reduce the VAT on reusable menstrual products \"Period Pants\" from 20% to 0%", "background": "In January 2021 the Government removed the VAT on menstrual products but failed to include period pants which continue to be taxed at 20%.
