However, the current pattern is well established and accepted. \r\nThere are eight permanent bank and public holidays in England and Wales. There are nine in Scotland and ten in Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nWhile an additional bank holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the overall cost to the economy is considerable.  The most recent estimate \u2013 from the impact assessment for the additional holiday for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 - is that a bank holiday (across the UK) costs the economy around \u00a31.2bn. The extra costs to certain businesses are substantial.  \r\n\r\nFull-time workers in the UK are entitled to 28 days statutory paid holiday each year.

HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, and help to rebalance opportunity fairly across the country. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.  During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history. \r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament. The Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable. Just this month, Andrew Stephenson MP, the dedicated HS2 minister, went before the Transport Select Committee to discuss HS2 in depth, and a record of this hearing can be found on Parliament.UK. \r\n\r\nMinisters have made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. \r\n\r\nWe are continuing work on managing the full impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on delivery of the HS2 programme. We intend to update Parliament on the latest position as part of the next six-monthly Parliamentary Report, expected in Spring 2021. \r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. The environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One. Alongside the Act, the Government also published a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project. \r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. Phase One expects to support 33 square kilometres of wildlife habitat - an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations. \r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nSecuring the land and property needed to construct the line of route across all Phases is vital to the programme\u2019s success and is often the first impact that we have on line of route communities. A range of statutory and non-statutory property compensation schemes are available that seek to compensate affected parties fairly while protecting the public purse.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to provide fair compensation for those directly and indirectly impacted but the process and disputes for claims can inevitably be traumatic for some. Andrew Stephenson commissioned a detailed review of the acquisition and compensation process to ensure that there is a renewed focus on those who are being impacted by the new railway. The report contained 36 recommendations which are actively being implemented which will see rapid improvements for local communities. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to repeal any legislation relating to the development and delivery of HS2.  However, we will continue to welcome further public and parliamentary scrutiny of the project. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-09-13", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-09-13/debates/3614AE85-A25C-4874-9DAE-9802247DFDDF/HS2", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yt-9ZsO5vg", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9313/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 593775, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/593775.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "End the Cage Age for all farmed animals", "background": "Every year across the UK, millions of farmed animals are kept in cages, unable to express their natural behaviours and experiencing huge suffering.

We are delivering a series of ambitious reforms, as outlined in the Action Plan for Animal Welfare which was published in May this year: Action Plan for Animal Welfare - (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/action-plan-for-animal-welfare). One of the ways we wish to improve the welfare of farm animals is strengthening protections against animal confinement. We are actively exploring options for UK food system and this includes phasing out the use of cages.\r\n\r\nWe have a strong track record for raising the bar when it comes to farm animal welfare standards, such as banning battery cages for laying hens and close confinement stalls for pigs. The UK banned sow stalls in 1999, whereas it was not until 2013 that a partial ban on sow stalls was introduced across the rest of the EU. Whatever the system of production, the most important factor in determining animal welfare is good stockmanship and the correct application of husbandry standards. This reflects the advice of our expert body, the Animal Welfare Committee (AWC).\r\n\r\nSince the 2012 EU ban on the use of conventional (\u201cbattery\u201d) cages for laying hens (in establishments with 350 or more laying hens), 55% of UK egg production is now free range, more than any country in the EU, with the rest in \u2018enriched\u2019 colony cages (40%), barn (2%), or organic (3%) systems.  We recognise the \u2018enriched\u2019 colony cage system restricts a bird\u2019s ability to exhibit normal behaviours, which is why we are examining all options for cage reform.\r\n\r\nThe UK is ahead of most other EU pig producing countries in terms of non-confinement farrowing, with approximately 40% of UK sows housed outside and free farrowed (crate-free), whilst 60% are housed in farrowing crates to give birth and nurse their piglets. Defra\u2019s code of practice for the welfare of pigs, published in March 2020, clearly states that the aim is for farrowing crates to no longer be necessary and for any new system to protect the welfare of the sow, as well as her piglets: Pigs: on-farm welfare - (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pigs-on-farm-welfare).\r\n\r\nThe UK unilaterally banned the keeping of calves in veal crates in 1990, sixteen years before the EU. However, as young calves are highly susceptible to disease, up to 8 weeks of age, they are currently permitted (both in the UK and the EU) to be kept in individual hutches of a specified size with bedding provided, as long as they have visual and tactile contact with other calves. AWC examined the evidence on group housing of calves in its Opinion on the Welfare of Cattle Kept in Different Production Systems, which was published in February this year: AWC opinion on the welfare of cattle kept in different production systems -  (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/awc-opinion-on-the-welfare-of-cattle-kept-in-different-production-systems). It recommended that The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 and the equivalent legislation in Wales and Scotland should be amended, to reduce the maximum age at which a calf may be routinely confined within an individual stall from eight weeks to one week. We welcome the move towards earlier grouping of calves because of the likely net welfare benefit.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to maintaining the UK\u2019s position as a world leader in farm animal welfare and want to improve and build upon that record, working in partnership with farmers to support healthier, higher welfare animals. We are co-designing an Animal Health and Welfare Pathway with industry which will launch in 2022. We are also working to support livestock farmers financially by using public funds to pay for health and welfare enhancements that are valued by the public and not currently delivered sufficiently by the market or through existing regulatory standards. This will promote the production of healthier animals at a level beyond compliance with current regulations.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-20T14:45:26.852Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-20T14:45:26.852Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2022-06-20", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-20/debates/A8711335-BF26-47F0-97B4-F6ED2471EB7F/FarmedAnimalsCages", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVnduOuv9-4", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2022-0114/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 333693, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/333693.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the shooting of badgers immediately", "background": "Shooting of Badgers is licensed by Natural England as part of the DEFRA Badger cull. 24,000+ Badgers were shot in 2019.", "additional_details": "Shooting is poorly monitored and Wild Justice believes it has never met the animal welfare standards recommended by a 2014 Independent Expert Panel, whose recommendations were accepted by DEFRA.

Around 30,000 cattle are slaughtered annually due to infection. Our cattle breeders suffer the loss of prize-winning animals and valued herds and this loss creates considerable trauma in the farming industry. It is important to bear in mind that, if left unchecked, bTB could pose an increased risk to animal and human health. It is a particular threat to the dairy and beef industries, which form part of an agri-food sector that contributes billions of pounds to the UK economy each year.\r\n\r\nOur 25-year strategy to eradicate bTB in England is founded in science. It applies the lessons learnt from previous attempts to control the disease, as well as drawing evidence from other countries, trial work conducted in the UK during the 1970s and, more recently, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial conducted between 1998 and 2007. \r\n\r\nSince the initial badger culls in 2013, a policy of badger control has been rolled out to other parts of the High-Risk Area (HRA) in the south-west and west of England. As of the end of 2019, 57% of the HRA is now subject to a licensed cull of badgers. This policy is starting to yield results. The latest peer-reviewed epidemiological analysis has shown that the incidence of the disease in the first cull areas of Somerset and Gloucester fell substantially, by 37% and 66% respectively relative to comparison areas.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs entered into an agreement with Natural England (NE) in October 2006 under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 authorising it to perform specified wildlife licensing functions, including those under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. NE is therefore responsible for granting, modifying or revoking badger control licences under the 1992 Act.\r\n\r\nNatural England (NE) carries out compliance monitoring which includes observations of controlled shooting in the field, and the results are published each year on GOV.UK. All applications that are received are carefully assessed by NE to ensure that each cull company has suitable arrangements and plans in place to carry out an operation that is safe, effective and humane.\r\n\r\nNE\u2019s Chief Scientist advised that marksmen continued to show high levels of discipline and compliance with the Best Practice Guide in 2019. The level of accuracy of controlled shooting continued to compare favourably with the range of outcomes when other control activities, currently accepted by society, have been assessed. \r\n\r\nHowever, the badger is an iconic, protected species. No one wants to cull them forever, and widespread badger culling was only ever envisaged as a phase of the strategy, not a perpetual state of affairs. Therefore, five years into the current strategy, it is appropriate to take stock and consider how our strategy might be evolved. That is why the government asked Professor Sir Charles Godfray to conduct a review, which concluded in October 2018. \r\n\r\nThe Godfray Review is clear that the evidence indicates that presence of infected badgers does pose a significant threat to local cattle herds. The review also considers that moving from lethal to non-lethal control of disease in badgers is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe Government's response to Professor Sir Charles Godfray's review noted that while it is important to retain the ability to introduce new cull zones where epidemiological evidence points to a reservoir of disease in badgers, we envisage that any remaining areas would join the current cull programme in the next few years and that the badger cull phase of the strategy would then wind down by the mid to late 2020s. This plan has not changed. It is unrealistic to switch immediately to badger vaccination, but we are already doing a great deal to make sure the transition happens. Culling would, however, remain an option thereafter where epidemiological assessment indicates that it is needed.\r\n\r\nIn July, the government announced that world-leading cattle bTB vaccination trials are set to get underway in England and Wales as a result of a major breakthrough by government scientists. These trials enable work to accelerate towards planned deployment of a cattle vaccine. While the candidate BCG vaccine will never provide full protection, it promises to be a valuable additional tool if deployed with a test to detect infected cattle among vaccinated cattle (DIVA test). Government scientists have now developed a candidate DIVA test. The government is committing the funding necessary to accelerate field trials towards the aim of securing marketing authorisations for both the vaccine and the DIVA test by 2025.\r\n\r\nThere is no single answer to tackling the scourge of bTB but by deploying a range of policy interventions, we can turn the tide on this terrible disease and achieve our long-term objective of eradicating it in England by 2038.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2020-10-12T17:22:18.917Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-12T17:22:18.917Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2022-03-21", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-21/debates/3A62786C-3340-47E7-9DC0-D95B1EE9BD57/BadgerCulling", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u22qv8pHnqU", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2022-0058/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 563943, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/563943.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Continue the ban on the use of Neonicotinoids", "background": "The EU placed a ban on the use of Neonicotinoids due to the adverse effect it has on bees and other pollinators.

The Government continues to support those restrictions. However, like EU Member States, we are able to consider applications for emergency authorisations in exceptional circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe Government has decided to grant an application for emergency authorisation to allow use of a product containing the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam for the treatment of sugar beet seed in 2021. This is in recognition of the potential danger posed to the 2021 crop from Beet yellows virus.  \r\n \r\nThe decision taken was informed by assessments and advice from the Health and Safety Executive, the UK Expert Committee on Pesticides and Defra\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser. Having considered their comments and analysis in full, the Government has decided to grant an emergency authorisation in order to provide emergency protection against viruses which have significantly impacted yields of the 2020 sugar beet crop while the beet industry develops alternative solutions. \r\n \r\nEmerging sugar beet seedlings are vulnerable to predation by aphids, which have the potential to spread Beet yellows virus. Sugar beet crops have been severely affected and 2020 yields are forecast to be down by 20-25% on previous years. Emergency authorisations for pesticides are only granted in exceptional circumstances where diseases or pests cannot be controlled by any other reasonable means.  \r\n  \r\nEmergency authorisations are used by countries across Europe. Ten EU countries including Belgium, Denmark and Spain have granted emergency authorisations for neonicotinoid seed treatments since 2018. Under EU legislation Member States may grant emergency authorisations in exceptional circumstances. The UK\u2019s approach to the use of emergency authorisations has not changed as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\r\n \r\nThis authorisation is for the use of Syngenta\u2019s Cruiser SB on the 2021 sugar beet crop for England only. The duration of authorisation is strictly limited to the period required to allow supply of the product. Sugar beet is a non-flowering crop that is only grown in the east of England. \r\n \r\nFurthermore, this exceptional use of Syngenta\u2019s Cruiser SB will be strictly controlled. Conditions of the authorisation include reduced application rate as well as a prohibition on any flowering crop being planted in the same field where the product has been used within 22 months of sugar beet, and a prohibition on oilseed rape being planted within 32 months of sugar beet. \r\n\r\nThe UK is a world leader in developing greener farming practices and upholds the highest standards of environmental and health protection. The Government is currently consulting on the draft National Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides which sets out the ambition to further minimise the risks and impacts of pesticides to human health and the environment.

The guidance states that the management of endometriosis-related fertility problems should have multidisciplinary team involvement with input from a fertility specialist. This includes the recommended diagnostic fertility tests or preoperative tests, as well as other recommended fertility treatments such as assisted reproduction that are included in the NICE guidelines on fertility problems (CG156) - https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG156\r\n\r\nThe level of provision of local health services available to patients, including fertility treatment, is a matter for Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), who have a statutory responsibility to commission healthcare services that meet the needs of their whole population. In respect of NHS fertility services for women with endometriosis, the Government expects CCGs and clinicians to take full account of relevant NICE guidelines. Where NICE guidance does not make a specific recommendations on a particular topic, such as egg-freezing for women undergoing treatment for endometriosis, it does not mean that it cannot be funded by the NHS, and local commissioners should make individual decisions based on an assessment of the evidence.\r\n\r\nNHS England also recommends the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines on the management of women with endometriosis -https://www.eshre.eu/Guidelines-and-Legal/Guidelines/Endometriosis-guideline.aspx. The guidance offers best practice advice on the effectiveness of medically assisted reproduction for endometriosis-associated infertility.\r\n\r\nThe Government understands the frustration around diagnosis times. NHS England advise that endometriosis is a gynecological condition in which some women are badly affected, while others might not have any noticeable symptoms. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of endometriosis is by a laparoscopy, an operation in which a camera is inserted into the pelvis via a small cut near the naval. The surgeon uses the camera to see the pelvic organs and look for any signs of endometriosis.  \r\n\r\nGiven the highly invasive nature of the diagnostic procedure and the varying degree to which women experience symptoms, it can be more appropriate to treat mild symptoms on clinical grounds and reserve a laparoscopy with its inherent risks for women with more significant symptoms.\r\n\r\nAll obstetricians and gynaecologists receive training in the diagnosis, investigation and management of endometriosis, which is specifically listed as a topic in the core curriculum for obstetrics and gynaecology.  \r\n\r\nNHS England leads on commissioning specialised services and has developed a service specification for severe endometriosis. NHS England expects all units treating women with severe endometriosis and their partners to provide care that meets the standards laid out in the specification. Women who would like more information, can visit www.nhs.uk and search for \u2018endometriosis\u2019.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, damaging taboos and stigmas remain around many areas of women\u2019s health, including gynaecological concerns, which can prevent women from starting conversations about their health or seeking support for a health issue. When women do speak about their health, all too often, they are not listened to. We absolutely must change this and that is why we are embarking on the first government-led women\u2019s health strategy for England. The Strategy will set an ambitious and positive new agenda to improve the health and well-being of women across England and marks a turning point in how the government approaches women\u2019s health \u2013 we are making women\u2019s voices heard and placing women\u2019s voices at the centre of this work.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the Women\u2019s Health Strategy reflects what women identify as priorities, the government launched a 12 week call for evidence which will run until 30 May 2021 to gather women\u2019s experiences and views regarding their health and care.

To support the valuation of high-rise buildings with cladding, the Royal Institution of Charted Surveyors (RICS), in conjunction with lenders devised the EWS1 process.

This response is relevant to England.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out our ambition to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste. We are making great strides to tackle plastic pollution. The Government\u2019s Resources and Waste Strategy for England, published in 2018, outlines the ways in which we will meet this ambition by taking action across each stage of the product lifecycle as we move towards a more circular economy:\r\nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nWe know more needs to be done and for the most problematic plastics we are going faster. This is why we have committed to work towards all plastic packaging on the market being recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. \r\n\r\nWe prefer to help people and companies make the right choice, rather than banning items outright. However, where progress is insufficient, we will explore alternative policy measures, which may involve bans as part of a wider strategic approach. For instance, in 2018, the Government introduced a ban on microbeads in rinse-off personal care products and in October 2020, we introduced restrictions on the supply of plastic straws, stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have reduced the use of single-use carrier bags by the main supermarket retailers by 95% with our 5p charge. To build on the success of this charge, we have now increased it to 10p and extended it to all retailers. We will continue to review the latest evidence on problematic products and/ or materials to take a systematic approach to reducing the use of unnecessary single-use plastic products.\r\n\r\nIt is for local authorities to comply with the legal and policy safeguards in place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage. The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (the NERC Act) requires all public authorities in England to have regard for conserving biodiversity in the exercise of their functions. Our most important designated sites and species are also protected under legislation. \r\n\r\nThe Government is introducing new requirements to maintain and enhance the natural environment in England. We are mandating biodiversity net gain in our landmark Environment Bill to ensure that new developments enhance habitats for biodiversity. Surfaces such as artificial grass are of no value to wildlife, so any developer or local authority seeking to demonstrate biodiversity net gain would be incentivised to avoid the use of such surfaces in their developments\u2019 shared green spaces. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Environment Bill strengthens the current NERC Act biodiversity duty on public authorities to require them to take action to conserve and enhance biodiversity; and introduces a reporting requirement for those public authorities with the greatest potential to enhance biodiversity. This will further incentivise public authorities to adopt approaches that improve the environment. We will also develop guidance to help local planning authorities identify actions they can take to comply with the strengthened duty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government has no plans to ban the use of artificial grass. We prefer to help people and organisations make the right choice rather than legislating on such matters. However, the use of artificial grass must comply with the legal and policy safeguards in place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage, while measures such as the strengthened biodiversity duty should serve to encourage public authorities to consider more sustainable alternatives.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-06-08T12:56:13.492Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-08T12:56:13.492Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608295, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608295.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Introduce an \"Ecological Damage Tax\" on Astroturf Lawns / Artificial Grass", "background": "Introduce a tax on Astroturf Lawns (either on the import, sale or install) in order to act as a deterrent and encourage land owners towards less damaging and more sustainable \"low maintenance\" landscaping options that are good for wildlife and climate.", "additional_details": "UK Gardens occupy more land than our Nature Reserves combined and are vital habitats for wildlife, providing food, shelter and a home for so many declining species.

The Government is committed to recognising the importance of trees \u2013 young and old - by delivering programmes and policies which bring the benefits of trees into all of our lives. We therefore recently launched a consultation on the England Tree Strategy. This includes proposals to increase protections for our trees and woodlands, including through improving the criteria for applying Tree Preservation Orders. Such proposals would build on existing work to protect trees through regulations and the planning system. Responses are invited to that consultation, which can be accessed through GOV.UK:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-a-tree-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nIn the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) an ancient or veteran tree is defined as: \u2018A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value.\u2019 Ancient and veteran trees are irreplaceable habitats, which are of great importance for wildlife, cultural, economic and historic value. The Government is committed to ensuring ancient and veteran trees are adequately protected and suitably managed to provide a wide range of social, environmental and economic benefits to society. We therefore strengthened the protection of ancient and veteran trees through the NPPF and the supporting National Planning Practice Guidance. The NPPF now recognises ancient and veteran trees as irreplaceable habitats and aligns the planning system more closely with Defra\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan, which aims to leave the environment in a better state for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe Government has long recognised public concern over tree felling and any impacts on woodlands, including ancient woodlands. The Forestry Commission is responsible for the licensing of sustainable tree felling across England. In respect of ancient trees, its decisions are underpinned by the Keepers of Time policy (2005) and the ancient and native woodland practice guidelines. The Forestry Commission works hard to ensure that illegal felling is discouraged and illegally felled woodland is restocked, taking appropriate enforcement action when necessary. We are taking further measures through the Environment Bill to give the Forestry Commission more powers to tackle illegal tree felling, further strengthening the protection of all wooded landscapes, including ancient trees. We are also using the Environment Bill to improve protection of our existing urban trees, by introducing a new duty on local highway authorities, to ensure they consult the public when considering felling urban street trees. This will ensure that the views of the public are considered in the management of these important assets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, as part of our current consultation on the England Tree Strategy, we are considering whether changes need to be made to the Tree Preservation Order criteria to improve protection for trees. Tightening the current criteria could improve consistency in the application of the policy and provide the opportunity to include more relevant factors to the environment, such as carbon sequestration. Feedback from stakeholders has shown us that Tree Preservation Orders are valued as a way to protect trees, but work is needed to bring the system up-to-date and ensure they are applied and enforced with consistency. Greater clarification of the criteria for making a Tree Preservation Order, including consideration of ecosystem service values, would be helpful. We would welcome views on this as part of the consultation.\r\n\r\nAncient trees provide valuable ecosystems services and are a living link to our society\u2019s social and economic history. Existing, proportionate regulations balance this inherent value with local accountability and national interest. With this suite of existing regulations and protections, ancient trees are well-protected and we therefore do not believe that further legal rights are necessary.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

The UK has a robust legislative framework for animal welfare, and consumer protection rules that prohibit misleading or deceptive trading.\r\n\r\nThe UK\u2019s rigorous regulatory system requires that no testing takes place if there is a validated non-animal alternative that would achieve the scientific outcomes sought. Project licence proposals for research on animals for which there is no non-animal alternative must comply fully with the principles of the 3Rs: replacement, reduction and refinement. \r\n\r\nThe testing of cosmetics and their ingredients on animals in the UK has been banned since 1998 and the UK has been instrumental in introducing this ban across the European Union and beyond. In 2015 the Government implemented a ban on the testing of finished household products on animals as well as a qualified ban on household product ingredients. This ban was a clear statement of the UK\u2019s commitment to animal welfare.\r\n\r\nThe Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) are in place to protect consumers from being misled about the products or services they buy. The CPRs prohibit traders in all sectors from engaging in misleading and deceptive commercial practices (primarily in the course of marketing and advertising) against consumers to the extent that they are likely to lead a consumer to make a decision which they otherwise would not have made.  This includes false or misleading statements on products as to whether, for example, they have been tested on animals or not. The Regulations also cover the omission of material information where goods are offered direct for sale to consumers and where the omission would be likely to affect the transactional decision of the average consumer.\r\n \r\nIn addition, there are controls in place on advertising in the UK. These are primarily by self-regulation under which the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has responsibility for ensuring compliance with the British Code of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing. The Code is a body of rules by which the industry agrees to abide. It requires all forms of advertising to be legal, decent, honest, truthful and prepared with a sense of responsibility to both consumer and society. The ASA are happy to look into concerns and details of how to complain can be found on the ASA\u2019s website at: https://www.asa.org.uk/.\r\n\r\nGiven the UK\u2019s rigorous regulatory system in this area, and the current consumer protection rules that prohibit misleading or deceptive trading, the Government has no plans to introduce new measures at this time.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, bringing our biggest cities closer together, boosting productivity and rebalancing opportunity fairly across the country. Once operational, it will provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes. During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history\r\n \r\nHS2 is at the heart of our plans to build back better from Covid-19, creating thousands of jobs and providing certainty at a time when people need it the most. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.\r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament, and the Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable.\r\n\r\nThe Transport Secretary has made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson, the dedicated HS2 minister, is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. The Department for Transport has also established a monthly Ministerial Task Force to provide strategic oversight, support and challenge for the successful delivery of Phases One and 2a. Earlier this year, Government reset the funding regime for HS2 Phase One including a Target Cost and funding envelope as well as providing revised estimates for the wider scheme, subject to the ongoing work on the Integrated Rail Plan.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to hold a public vote on whether HS2 proceeds.\r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. That is why the UK was the first major economy in the world to legislate for net zero and why we have published a 25-year Environment Plan setting out what we will do to protect and enhance our natural environment for future generations. The UK is decarbonising faster than any other country in the G20 and is providing global leadership on climate change.\r\n\r\nThe environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One of the scheme. Alongside the Act, the Government also published the Environmental Minimum Requirements, a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project.\r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. On Phase One alone over 33 square kilometres of new and existing wildlife habitat will be created, an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations.\r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

This commitment is  stated in the National Planning Policy Framework and supporting guidance, to which all local planning authorities should have regard when drawing up local plans, or determining planning applications.  The Framework expects local authorities to not only protect landscapes, soils and sites of biodiversity but go further by enhancing these valued surroundings. The Framework also outlines that the character and beauty of the countryside, including trees and woodland, should be recognised in the planning of future development.  Strong protections are in place for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated land. The Government will continue to apply policy and law as appropriate to prevent harm to wildlife-rich habitat, and to restrict development in open countryside.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to making the most of brownfield land.  The Framework strongly encourages regeneration and re-use of brownfield, especially for housing - helping to level up communities across the country while taking off some of the pressure to consider other land, such as Green Belt, for new homes. The Framework expects local authorities to give substantial weight to re-using suitable brownfield when Plan-making or deciding planning applications. These sites should be given priority where practical and viable, and local authorities should consider building up, and higher densities in towns.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n- the term \u2018brownfield\u2019 comprises almost all types of previously developed land, including inhabited housing and land occupied by functioning businesses and industry;   \r\n- not all vacant brownfield is in the right place for sustainable residential use; \r\n- some is valuable for ecology; \r\n- some has high upfront costs for demolition or decontamination; \r\n- each local authority is already required by law to publish a register of brownfield land in its area that would be suitable for housing-led development;\r\n- not all owners will wish to develop or release sites, for different reasons; and \r\n- the rules on compulsory purchase of building sites are strict, and generally require compensation for the owner, reflecting the current land value.\r\n\r\nElected local authorities are responsible for deciding the right location and type of sustainable future development in each area, in accordance with national policies in the Framework. Rightly, planning decisions are not made on the basis of the number of objectors or supporters. Instead, each local authority is responsible for preparing a vision for future development in its area using a Local Plan. The Local Plan outlines how land should be used and takes account of any necessary restraints on development. The Plan is created in consultation with the local community, and submitted for rigorous independent examination by a planning inspector. If the Plan is judged to be properly prepared, justified, and consistent with national policy in the Framework, it can come into effect. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that to help make home ownership affordable for more people, and help more people rent their own home, we need to deliver more homes. To get enough homes built in the places where people and communities need them, a crucial first step is to plan for the right number of homes. Local housing need introduced in 2018 is a measure of an area\u2019s housing need, against which councils must then consider their local circumstances and supply pipeline. Local authorities draw up a local housing target, taking into account factors including land availability and environmental constraints such as Green Belt. Following consultation to changes to the method (from August to October 2020) on 16 December 2020 we changed the formula to increase need in the 20 most populated urban areas. \r\n\r\nProtecting the Green Belt remains a priority and our national planning policy reinforces regenerating previously developed land, known as brownfield sites, and prioritising urban areas. The uplift in local housing needed within our biggest cities and urban centres in England will direct homes to where they are better served by infrastructure, and therefore protect our countryside. It also supports our wider objectives of regenerating brownfield sites, renewal, and levelling up. Green Belt decisions as outlined above will remain with local authorities and communities, ensuring they have influence over development, location and design.\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to apply strong policies to limit harm to Green Belt and the countryside, this Government is encouraging local authorities to make the most of their brownfield land. We are providing extensive financial support for this.  For example, in 2020 the Prime Minister announced that seven Mayoral Combined Authorities would receive a share of the \u00a3400 million Brownfield Housing Fund. This will help unlock 26,000 homes across England by bringing under-utilised brownfield land back into use. In addition we are investing \u00a375 million in a Brownfield Land Release Fund for authorities not eligible for the Brownfield Housing Fund. This is new capital funding to accelerate release of local authority-owned land for housing. The Brownfield Land Release Fund is expected to release land for 7,000 homes by 2024.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government", "created_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 578875, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/578875.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Remove single person protest clauses in Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill", "background": "The Government\u2019s new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill contains clauses designed specifically to stifle single individuals legitimately protesting.

Based on evidence available, we have concluded that an outright ban would be disproportionate in the circumstances.", "details": "The Government recognises concerns that sky lanterns and balloons can pose a threat to the environment and wildlife. For this reason, Defra and the Welsh Government commissioned an independent study in 2013 into the impacts of sky lanterns and helium balloons on the health and welfare of livestock. The report concluded that these impacts were relatively minor. Any action the Government takes must be proportionate to the level of risk and we have concluded that an outright ban would be disproportionate in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no legislation that specifically regulates the release of balloons or sky lanterns, voluntary actions and initiatives aimed at minimising the risks associated with sky lanterns and driving up safety standards have been effective. Initiatives include publication of a Trading Standards Institute voluntary code of practice for sky lanterns to ensure that they are manufactured to be safe and sold responsibly. Sky lanterns also fall in scope of the General Product Safety Regulations 2005 which oblige producers and distributors to place only safe consumer products on the market. These regulations are enforced by local authority Trading Standards services across the UK.\r\n\r\nWe have also provided local authorities with powers to restrict or ban the use of sky lanterns on council or public land and, as the petition notes, many local authorities have already put such measures in place.\r\n\r\nAs the law stands in England, it is conceivable that a magistrates\u2019 court would conclude that a release of balloons or sky lanterns constitutes a littering offence. Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 says: \u201cA person is guilty of an offence if he throws down, drops or otherwise deposits any litter in any place to which this section applies and leaves it\u201d. Ultimately it would be for a court to rule whether this phrase would cover balloon or sky lantern releases.\r\n\r\nCouncils in England have the necessary powers to take an individual whom they believe to be guilty of a littering offence to court or, as an alternative, issue a fixed penalty notice. Where a case does go to court, the magistrate will determine whether a particular incident constitutes a littering offence and, if so, the appropriate fine. It would be up to the council to decide whether bringing a prosecution for releasing balloons or sky lanterns was appropriate and a good use of its funds.\r\n\r\nThe Government considers the current voluntary and regulatory regime, supported by existing guidance on the safe manufacture and use of sky lanterns, is effective and proportionate. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2020-10-05T16:06:04.101Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-05T16:06:04.101Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 601485, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/601485.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the sale and use of artificial grass for residential properties", "background": "The UK Government has previously responded to calls for the banning of artificial grass by stating that they 'prefer to help people and companies make the right choice, rather than banning items outright'.

Given the scale of the plastics problem, we need to take a targeted and evidence-led approach to tackling the issues of plastic waste.

This will further incentivise public authorities to adopt approaches that improve the environment.

The new prisons would also create over 1,200 permanent jobs in the local area once the prisons were operational and hundreds of local jobs during construction.\r\n \r\nThe MoJ ran a pre-planning public consultation to seek feedback from the local community on these proposals in the Braintree District. The consultation ran from 27 September until 8 November with face to face consultation sessions on the 14 and 15 October. Residents were able to have their say by submitting comments online, over the phone or by post. We appreciate the feedback received and had around 1,800 responses.\r\n \r\nThe MoJ are currently deciding whether to proceed to submitting a planning application for new prisons on the Wethersfield site and taking time to consider the information received from the public consultation, stakeholder engagement and the results of ecological surveys on the site.\r\n  \r\nThe MoJ are committed to adhering to the Environment Act and have followed due process by engaging ecologists to conduct relevant surveys and provide the necessary advice on mitigation action required to offset the impact of the proposed development. A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, reptile survey, and dormouse survey were conducted in 2020. A Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), great crested newt surveys, invasive non-native species survey, and an updated Phase 1 habitat survey were conducted in 2021. A Wintering Bird Survey was conducted in winter 2021/2022. A bat Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA) has been conducted in 2022, and the following surveys are ongoing: bat activity surveys, bat roost surveys of buildings, invertebrate surveys, and a botanical survey.\r\n \r\nThe findings of these surveys have guided, and would continue to guide, the formulation of an appropriate mitigation response to the impacts of the proposed development. An ecology chapter would form part of the Environmental Statement for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) if a planning application is submitted.\r\n \r\nTo mitigate the ecological impact of building on this site, prison landscaping would use native planting and seed mixes as far as possible.  \r\n\r\nThe loss of any trees, scrub, and buildings would be mitigated/compensated. Brown hares use the site, and appropriate mitigation/compensation would be provided. Great crested newt impacts are limited to habitats on land (no ponds would be lost), and we propose following the District Level Licensing route with Natural England, to offset any impacts.\r\n  \r\nThe invertebrate surveys target a wide range of rare and notable species, including priority species. We are confident that the needs of any priority species can be accommodated within the habitat provisions envisaged.\r\n \r\nThe MOJ is committed to Environment Act and to the protection of wildlife. The MoJ currently operates a number of prisons in Sites of Special Scientific interest (SSSI\u2019s) and on sites with protected species of birds and other wildlife.
