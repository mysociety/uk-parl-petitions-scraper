To this end, we operate a strict system for regulating pesticides.\r\n\r\nA pesticide may only be placed on the market in the UK if the product has been authorised by our regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, following a thorough risk assessment, which includes impacts on people, animals and the environment. If there are found to be unacceptable risks, to pollinators for example, the product is not authorised. The risk assessment also specifically addresses the situation of people living near where pesticides are used. Pesticide users are legally required to ensure that use is kept to the area to be treated and not allowed to drift onto neighbouring properties, and there are statutory conditions of use for all authorised pesticide products that must be followed. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to supporting alternatives to chemical pesticides. In our 25 Year Environment Plan, the Government has outlined its approach to reducing the environmental impact of pesticides. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) lies at the heart of our approach to maximise the use of non-chemical control techniques and minimise the use of chemical pesticides. IPM is defined as the combined use of all available control methods. This means that pesticide users can take a holistic approach in reducing the associated risks (including indirect effects) whilst combating pest resistance. IPM also includes measures to optimise pesticide application, with the aim of reducing non target effects and unnecessary environmental exposure. This includes increasing the use of nature-based, low toxicity solutions and precision technologies, with the potential to enhance biodiversity, as well as benefit pollinators.   \r\n \r\nOur approach is detailed in the draft revised \u2018National Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides\u2019 (NAP), which sets out the ambition to improve indicators of pesticide usage, risk and impacts. This was the subject of a recent public consultation, with over 1,500 responses received and analysed. The summary of responses will be published in due course and the revised NAP later this year.  \r\n  \r\nThe objective must be to reduce the risks and impacts associated with pesticides. These depend not only on the amount of pesticide used, but which pesticide is used and where use takes place. The draft revised NAP supports the development of low toxicity methods and improved advice and support for pesticides users, to reduce their impacts on human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nWe are also taking action alongside many partners to implement the National Pollinator Strategy\u2019s provisions to help wild and managed pollinators to thrive. The Strategy sets out actions to address key risks and pressures, such as: habitat loss and fragmentation; invasive species; pests and disease; and climate change. This includes supporting IPM by restoring and creating habitats in rural and urban areas, including parks and gardens, and raising awareness across society so that people can take action themselves, by carefully considering whether or not to use pesticides in gardens, parks and other urban areas.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, our Environment Bill sets a new legal foundation for Government action to improve the environment. For example, it introduces Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs) to underpin the development of the Nature Recovery Network (NRN), an expanded and better-connected network of places that are richer in wildlife, more resilient to climate change and provide a range of benefits for people. LNRSs and the NRN Delivery Partnership, led by Natural England, will help bring people and organisations together at local and national levels to identify priorities and opportunities for nature recovery. We are integrating the goals for the network into a wide range of funding streams, including: land management schemes that reward environmental benefits; biodiversity net gain; and the Nature for Climate Fund.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-08-20T13:07:15.911Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-20T13:07:15.911Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 569214, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/569214.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Overturn the decision to allow the use of neonicotinoid pesticides", "background": "Defra has granted farmers in England the temporary right to use the insecticide thiamethoxam for a 120-day period to combat a virus in sugar beet.

Emergency authorisations are used by countries across Europe. Pesticides can only be used where we judge there to be no harm to human health and animal health and no unacceptable risks to the environment. \r\n\r\nThis exceptional use of Syngenta\u2019s Cruiser SB will be strictly controlled and is for the 2021 sugar beet crop in England only. The duration of authorisation is strictly limited to the period required to allow supply of the product. The temporary use of this product is strictly limited to a non-flowering crop and will be tightly controlled to minimise any potential risk to pollinators. \r\n\r\nEmerging sugar beet seedlings are vulnerable to predation by aphids which have the potential to spread beet yellows virus. Sugar beet crops have been severely affected and 2020 yields are forecast to be down by 20-25% on previous years. The neonicotinoid Syngenta\u2019s Cruiser SB will provide emergency protection while the beet industry develops alternative solutions. Its exceptional use will be strictly controlled.\r\n\r\nConditions of the authorisation include reduced application rate as well as a prohibition on any flowering crop being planted in the same field where the product has been used within 22 months of sugar beet and a prohibition on oilseed rape being planted with 32 months of sugar beet.\r\n\r\nTen EU countries including Belgium, Denmark and Spain - most EU countries with significant sugar production - have granted emergency authorisations for neonicotinoid seed treatments following the EU-wide ban - backed by the UK (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-secretary-backs-further-restrictions-on-neonicotinoid-pesticides) - coming into force. We now operate an autonomous GB pesticides regime and will continue to ensure that decisions on the use of pesticides are based on careful scientific assessment of the risks, with the aim of achieving a high level of protection for people and the environment. The UK\u2019s approach to the use of emergency authorisations has therefore not changed as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that it is right to minimise the use of pesticides so that pesticides are only applied when necessary. Our 25 Year Environment Plan puts integrated pest management (IPM) at the heart of our approach to support sustainable crop protection with the minimum use of pesticides. We are working to encourage more effective uptake of IPM methods that reduce dependence on pesticides. The Government is currently consulting on the draft National Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides which sets out the ambition to further minimise the risks and impacts of pesticides to human health and the environment. The consultation is open until 26 February:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/sustainable-use-of-pesticides-draft-national-action-plan. \r\n\r\nProtecting pollinators continues to be a priority for this Government. The National Pollinator Strategy sets out actions to address key risks to insect populations, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, potential harm from pesticide use and climate change. Through this strategy, we are working with conservation groups, farmers, beekeepers and researchers to improve the status of pollinating insect species in England. For example, we are funding habitat restoration and creation and have introduced systematic monitoring of pollinators across Great Britain. We are also working with partners on species recovery and re-introduction, such as the short-haired bumblebee in Kent.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-23T16:06:03.762Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-23T16:06:03.762Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 618926, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/618926.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Save the bees: cut hazardous pesticides and support nature-friendly farming", "background": "The Government should introduce an ambitious target for pesticide reduction, aimed at decreasing the overall amount used and toxicity levels.

The exceptional temporary use (in England only) of a neonicotinoid pesticide treatment on the 2022 sugar beet crop is the outcome of an emergency authorisation, granted with very strict conditions to mitigate risks to bees and other pollinators.\r\n\r\nThe Government's landmark Environment Act 2021 commits to halting the decline in biodiversity by 2030. Developing and implementing policies that maximise the use of alternatives to pesticides, while ensuring pests and pesticide resistance are managed effectively, will play an important role in achieving this.\r\n\r\nEmerging sugar beet seedlings are vulnerable to predation by aphids which have the potential to spread beet yellows virus. Sugar beet crops have been severely affected, with 2020 yields down by a quarter on previous years. Other pesticide and organic treatments are not sufficiently effective in controlling the virus.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 emergency authorisation was granted subject to strict conditions including an initial threshold for use, to ensure the seed treatment is used only if the predicted virus incidence is at or above 19% of the national crop according to independent modelling. \r\n\r\nFurther conditions include a prohibition on any flowering crop being planted in the same field where the product has been used within 32 months of a treated sugar beet crop. To further mitigate the risks, the maximum amount of treatment approved for use is 6% of the quantity of active substance applied on a range of crops in 2016 before neonicotinoids were prohibited.\r\n\r\n63% of the UK\u2019s sugar comes from domestic production of sugar beet which could be at risk if a significant amount of the national crop is infected. The strictly time limited emergency authorisation of this neonicotinoid treatment provides emergency protection against this virus, which could significantly impact yields of the sugar beet crop while the beet industry develops alternative solutions. \r\n\r\nThe EU restricted three neonicotinoid pesticides, including thiamethoxam, in 2018 due to evidence of their harm to pollinators. The UK supported this move. Emergency authorisations of pesticides are used by countries across Europe. Twelve EU countries including Belgium, Denmark and Spain have granted emergency authorisations for neonicotinoid seed treatments since 2018. The UK\u2019s approach to the use of emergency authorisations has not changed as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU and we applied the most stringent conditions for its emergency use. \r\n\r\nPollinators are a priority for this government, and we are taking action alongside many partners to implement the National Pollinator Strategy\u2019s provisions.

The Government is also incentivising sustainable approaches to pest management, including through Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches. \r\n\r\nIPM is a holistic approach which carefully considers all available plant protection methods and keeps the use of pesticides to levels that are ecologically and economically justified.

These technologies can make targeted genetic changes to produce the beneficial traits that can also occur through traditional breeding and natural processes.\r\n\r\nThe scientific advice from our independent Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Biology and the Roslin Institute, is that precision bred organisms pose no greater risk to the environment or health than their traditionally bred counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill aims to create a new, proportionate regulatory regime for organisms produced through precision breeding technologies, where the genetic changes could have arisen through traditional breeding processes.\r\n\r\nThe primary policy objective of the Bill is to ensure that plants, animals and food and feed products developed from them, using precision breeding technologies, are regulated proportionately to risk.  The Bill will introduce simpler regulatory measures to enable these products to be authorised and brought to market more easily.\r\n \r\nThe four key policy changes are to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Remove plants and animals produced through precision breeding technologies from regulatory requirements applicable to the environmental release and marketing of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Introduce two notification systems; one for precision bred organisms used for research purposes and the other for marketing purposes. The information collected will be published on a public register.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Establish a proportionate regulatory system for precision bred animals to ensure animal welfare is safeguarded. We will not be introducing changes to the regulations for animals until this system is in place.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Establish a new science-based authorisation process for food and feed products developed using precision bred organisms.\r\n\r\nWe want to safeguard animal welfare and that is why we are taking a step-by-step approach by bringing into effect legislation for precision bred plants first, followed by animals.\r\n\r\nAll animals are protected by comprehensive animal health and welfare legislation, including the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which makes it an offence to either cause any captive animal any unnecessary suffering or to fail to provide for the needs of the animal.  This is supplemented by detailed farmed animal welfare legislation, which includes specific requirements to protect animals when bred or kept.\r\n\r\nThe use of animals for research, including any which have been the subject of genetic technology processes, is regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA).\r\n\r\nIn the Bill we have ensured that before marketing precision bred animals, developers will need to provide assurances to confirm that the welfare of the animal (and its offspring) will not be adversely affected by any trait resulting from precision breeding.  This will be in the form of an animal welfare declaration where an independent scientific expert committee and Defra\u2019s Secretary of State will need to be satisfied with the declaration before authorising that a precision bred animal can be marketed.\r\n\r\nGenetic improvement through breeding has been at the heart of livestock production since modern agriculture began.  Selective breeding and, more recently, genomic selection using genetic marker data, have been transformational for livestock productivity and health. Precision breeding has a vital role to play in helping improve animal health and welfare and reduce the carbon footprint of livestock production. There are already examples of research taking place across the UK to develop resistance against some devastating diseases such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in pigs, bird flu in chickens and Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis virus in fish.\r\n\r\nThe UK has a proud history of taking action on animal welfare, and the Government fully recognises the important issues around maintaining animal welfare as part of genetic improvement through breeding.
