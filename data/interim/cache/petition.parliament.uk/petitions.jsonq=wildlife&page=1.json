The Government also recognises that many of these organisations in the UK, as well as providing high welfare standards for their animals, contribute significantly to both conservation work and education, helping both sustain endangered species but also teaching people about animals\u2019 natural habitats - as well as how at risk that species may be.\r\n   \r\nAs announced by the Prime Minister on 10 June, outdoor animal attractions, including safari parks, the outdoor parts of zoos and animal attractions on farms, are now able to reopen, following strict social distancing guidelines. This includes keeping indoor exhibitions, such as reptile houses and those in aquariums, closed, and ensuring other amenities like cafes offer take-away services only.\r\n\r\nThe move follows close work by the Government with the zoo industry to ensure visitor numbers can be managed and safeguards are put in place. Allowing zoos to reopen is an integral step towards supporting an early financial recovery.\r\n\r\nThe decision to relax restrictions on these select outdoor attractions is part of the Government\u2019s careful approach to easing the lockdown in phases, guided by the advice of scientific and medical experts and the fact the risk of transmission is much lower outdoors.\r\n\r\nA number of schemes have been made available to businesses and charities to help them during this emergency. Organisations are eligible to apply for a range of support schemes including the Job Retention Scheme, VAT deferral, Business Rates Relief, the Business Interruption Loan schemes, the option to reclaim the costs of Statutory Sick Pay and grant funding of up to \u00a325,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government launched a Zoos Support Fund on 4 May worth \u00a314m in direct response to the concerns raised by zoos and aquariums as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Licensed zoos or aquariums in England that are experiencing severe financial difficulties because of lost revenue can apply for a grant of up to \u00a3100,000.  The fund is intended to help zoos at immediate risk to protect the welfare of animals living on site or by rehoming.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of the concerns raised by larger zoos. Defra continues to engage with the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury (HMT) to monitor how zoos are doing.  Officials continue to meet regularly with some of the major zoos and aquariums in England to identify the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on larger organisations. This includes monitoring concerns around potential implications for animal welfare. Consideration of proposals for any longer-term support that might be needed for the sector is ongoing. With the help and support of the industry, Defra is working diligently to find the best way forward.\r\n\r\nThe importance of allowing zoos to reopen was also debated in the House of Commons on 11 June in the adjournment debate on the reopening of zoos, aquariums and wildlife sanctuaries.

This is in recognition of the potential danger posed to the 2021 crop from Beet yellows virus.  \r\n \r\nThe decision taken was informed by assessments and advice from the Health and Safety Executive, the UK Expert Committee on Pesticides and Defra\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser. Having considered their comments and analysis in full, the Government has decided to grant an emergency authorisation in order to provide emergency protection against viruses which have significantly impacted yields of the 2020 sugar beet crop while the beet industry develops alternative solutions. \r\n \r\nEmerging sugar beet seedlings are vulnerable to predation by aphids, which have the potential to spread Beet yellows virus. Sugar beet crops have been severely affected and 2020 yields are forecast to be down by 20-25% on previous years. Emergency authorisations for pesticides are only granted in exceptional circumstances where diseases or pests cannot be controlled by any other reasonable means.  \r\n  \r\nEmergency authorisations are used by countries across Europe. Ten EU countries including Belgium, Denmark and Spain have granted emergency authorisations for neonicotinoid seed treatments since 2018. Under EU legislation Member States may grant emergency authorisations in exceptional circumstances. The UK\u2019s approach to the use of emergency authorisations has not changed as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\r\n \r\nThis authorisation is for the use of Syngenta\u2019s Cruiser SB on the 2021 sugar beet crop for England only. The duration of authorisation is strictly limited to the period required to allow supply of the product. Sugar beet is a non-flowering crop that is only grown in the east of England. \r\n \r\nFurthermore, this exceptional use of Syngenta\u2019s Cruiser SB will be strictly controlled. Conditions of the authorisation include reduced application rate as well as a prohibition on any flowering crop being planted in the same field where the product has been used within 22 months of sugar beet, and a prohibition on oilseed rape being planted within 32 months of sugar beet. \r\n\r\nThe UK is a world leader in developing greener farming practices and upholds the highest standards of environmental and health protection.

To this end, we operate a strict system for regulating pesticides.\r\n\r\nA pesticide may only be placed on the market in the UK if the product has been authorised by our regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, following a thorough risk assessment, which includes impacts on people, animals and the environment. If there are found to be unacceptable risks, to pollinators for example, the product is not authorised. The risk assessment also specifically addresses the situation of people living near where pesticides are used. Pesticide users are legally required to ensure that use is kept to the area to be treated and not allowed to drift onto neighbouring properties, and there are statutory conditions of use for all authorised pesticide products that must be followed. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to supporting alternatives to chemical pesticides. In our 25 Year Environment Plan, the Government has outlined its approach to reducing the environmental impact of pesticides. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) lies at the heart of our approach to maximise the use of non-chemical control techniques and minimise the use of chemical pesticides. IPM is defined as the combined use of all available control methods. This means that pesticide users can take a holistic approach in reducing the associated risks (including indirect effects) whilst combating pest resistance. IPM also includes measures to optimise pesticide application, with the aim of reducing non target effects and unnecessary environmental exposure. This includes increasing the use of nature-based, low toxicity solutions and precision technologies, with the potential to enhance biodiversity, as well as benefit pollinators.   \r\n \r\nOur approach is detailed in the draft revised \u2018National Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides\u2019 (NAP), which sets out the ambition to improve indicators of pesticide usage, risk and impacts. This was the subject of a recent public consultation, with over 1,500 responses received and analysed. The summary of responses will be published in due course and the revised NAP later this year.  \r\n  \r\nThe objective must be to reduce the risks and impacts associated with pesticides. These depend not only on the amount of pesticide used, but which pesticide is used and where use takes place. The draft revised NAP supports the development of low toxicity methods and improved advice and support for pesticides users, to reduce their impacts on human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nWe are also taking action alongside many partners to implement the National Pollinator Strategy\u2019s provisions to help wild and managed pollinators to thrive. The Strategy sets out actions to address key risks and pressures, such as: habitat loss and fragmentation; invasive species; pests and disease; and climate change. This includes supporting IPM by restoring and creating habitats in rural and urban areas, including parks and gardens, and raising awareness across society so that people can take action themselves, by carefully considering whether or not to use pesticides in gardens, parks and other urban areas.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, our Environment Bill sets a new legal foundation for Government action to improve the environment. For example, it introduces Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs) to underpin the development of the Nature Recovery Network (NRN), an expanded and better-connected network of places that are richer in wildlife, more resilient to climate change and provide a range of benefits for people. LNRSs and the NRN Delivery Partnership, led by Natural England, will help bring people and organisations together at local and national levels to identify priorities and opportunities for nature recovery. We are integrating the goals for the network into a wide range of funding streams, including: land management schemes that reward environmental benefits; biodiversity net gain; and the Nature for Climate Fund.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-08-20T13:07:15.911Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-20T13:07:15.911Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 560288, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/560288.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Make glue traps illegal within the UK", "background": "Make it illegal for both glue traps to be sold and used within the UK to stop the suffering of animals.", "additional_details": "Glue traps are used commonly to capture wildlife and unwanted pests.

It is an issue we are looking at very closely as part of our continued drive to maintain the highest animal welfare standards in the world. Anyone using glue traps has a responsibility under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 to act within the law to ensure their activities do not cause any unnecessary suffering.\r\n\r\nAt present, the use of glue traps is a lawful method of pest control for mammals (unless specially protected) in England. We have developed a code of practice for the humane use of glue traps, which is the legal responsibility of the pest controller. The code of practice states that glue boards should be inspected within 12 hours of placing and revisited at a minimum of every 12 hours.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not monitor operators of glue traps: the onus is on operators to act within the law. Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 it remains the responsibility of the pest controller to deal with any animals trapped on the board. The Act requires that caught animals must not be subjected to unnecessary suffering and should be dispatched humanely as soon as they are discovered. All other options for pest control should have been considered and found to have failed, or to be inappropriate, before the use of glue traps/sticky boards is implemented.\r\n\r\nIf any person believes an individual is using illegal methods of pest control or inflicting unnecessary suffering on animals, the matter should be reported to the police. It would be for the courts to decide whether the method of entrapment caused any suffering and if so, if this was unnecessary, in any particular case that was brought before them. The current penalty for causing unnecessary suffering to animals under the Animal Welfare Act is six months imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.\r\n\r\nWe continue to look at this matter closely and would reiterate that the most effective long-term solutions for pest control are preventative and deterrent strategies, such as removing or proofing food and shelter sources.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Environment Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-04-22T12:25:04.959Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-22T12:25:04.959Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 314968, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/314968.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Include animal charities in emergency funding due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "background": "The government have announced financial help packages for charities but animal welfare charities are not included.\r\nMany animal charities (wildlife, rescue, service & companion animal charities) will be forced to close due to lack of funding during this terrible time.", "additional_details": "Animal welfare charities are often excluded from funding opportunities (the National Lottery being a good case in point).\r\nMy own interest, wildlife rehabilitation, is necessary because of the damage that we do to wild animals and their habitats.\r\nOver 95% of the casualties that we treat annually have sustained their injuries through interaction with humans (road accidents, poisoning, litter related injuries, house building, habitat destruction - the list is endless).

In addition, the Government has acted quickly to assist zoos and aquariums through the Zoo Support Fund which has made up to \u00a3100 million available to help to maintain a high standard of care for their animals during the coronavirus pandemic. A portion of this funding has been awarded to zoos that are charities, which has enabled them to continue providing vital care to their wild animals. \r\n\r\nAs well as the Job Retention Scheme, charities are eligible to apply for a range of other support schemes including the VAT deferral, Business Rates Relief, the Business Interruption Loan schemes, the option to reclaim the costs of Statutory Sick Pay and grant funding of up to \u00a325,000 through the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that there will be further demands on the sector as we recover from the current pandemic and that these impacts will continue for some time even beyond the immediate end of the crisis. For example, there are concerns about increased abandonment of pet, and ensuring their continued care.\r\n\r\nThe Government welcomes the in-sector initiatives to help animal welfare charities with the launch of several emergency grant schemes, to assist animal rescue and rehoming centres.

This response is relevant to England.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out our ambition to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste. We are making great strides to tackle plastic pollution. The Government\u2019s Resources and Waste Strategy for England, published in 2018, outlines the ways in which we will meet this ambition by taking action across each stage of the product lifecycle as we move towards a more circular economy:\r\nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nWe know more needs to be done and for the most problematic plastics we are going faster. This is why we have committed to work towards all plastic packaging on the market being recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. \r\n\r\nWe prefer to help people and companies make the right choice, rather than banning items outright. However, where progress is insufficient, we will explore alternative policy measures, which may involve bans as part of a wider strategic approach. For instance, in 2018, the Government introduced a ban on microbeads in rinse-off personal care products and in October 2020, we introduced restrictions on the supply of plastic straws, stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have reduced the use of single-use carrier bags by the main supermarket retailers by 95% with our 5p charge. To build on the success of this charge, we have now increased it to 10p and extended it to all retailers. We will continue to review the latest evidence on problematic products and/ or materials to take a systematic approach to reducing the use of unnecessary single-use plastic products.\r\n\r\nIt is for local authorities to comply with the legal and policy safeguards in place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage. The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (the NERC Act) requires all public authorities in England to have regard for conserving biodiversity in the exercise of their functions. Our most important designated sites and species are also protected under legislation. \r\n\r\nThe Government is introducing new requirements to maintain and enhance the natural environment in England. We are mandating biodiversity net gain in our landmark Environment Bill to ensure that new developments enhance habitats for biodiversity. Surfaces such as artificial grass are of no value to wildlife, so any developer or local authority seeking to demonstrate biodiversity net gain would be incentivised to avoid the use of such surfaces in their developments\u2019 shared green spaces. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Environment Bill strengthens the current NERC Act biodiversity duty on public authorities to require them to take action to conserve and enhance biodiversity; and introduces a reporting requirement for those public authorities with the greatest potential to enhance biodiversity. This will further incentivise public authorities to adopt approaches that improve the environment. We will also develop guidance to help local planning authorities identify actions they can take to comply with the strengthened duty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government has no plans to ban the use of artificial grass. We prefer to help people and organisations make the right choice rather than legislating on such matters. However, the use of artificial grass must comply with the legal and policy safeguards in place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage, while measures such as the strengthened biodiversity duty should serve to encourage public authorities to consider more sustainable alternatives.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-06-08T12:56:13.492Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-08T12:56:13.492Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608295, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608295.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Introduce an \"Ecological Damage Tax\" on Astroturf Lawns / Artificial Grass", "background": "Introduce a tax on Astroturf Lawns (either on the import, sale or install) in order to act as a deterrent and encourage land owners towards less damaging and more sustainable \"low maintenance\" landscaping options that are good for wildlife and climate.", "additional_details": "UK Gardens occupy more land than our Nature Reserves combined and are vital habitats for wildlife, providing food, shelter and a home for so many declining species.

It is an offence under section 3(1) of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to allow a dog to be dangerously out of control. Under section 2 of the Dogs Act 1871, a magistrates' court may make any Order they consider appropriate to require an owner to ensure that their dog is kept under proper control. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 also includes specific measures such as community protection notices to enable the police and local authorities to tackle irresponsible dog ownership. The Act also gives powers to local authorities to make public space protection orders to impose conditions on designated spaces such as excluding dogs or requiring them to be kept on leads.\r\n\r\nSeals are vulnerable to any kind of human interactions, either deliberate or unintentional. The Government recognises that unintentional disturbance by members of the public can be detrimental and, on occasion, fatal to seals, and that greater public awareness is needed to protect these vulnerable marine mammals. Therefore, together with Seal Alliance, during the Spring we launched a new Government-backed campaign, \u2018Give Seals Space\u2019, to help raise awareness of the impact that human disturbance can have on seals and to help reduce it. As part of this campaign, we are providing funding for signs to be put up on the banks of the Thames to help raise awareness of the impact of disturbance on seals and the importance of keeping dogs under close control.\r\n\r\nTo deal with rising numbers of summer visitors to our coastlines, \u2018Operation Seabird\u2019 aims to tackle increases in disturbance to marine wildlife, including seals, by providing education and guidance to prevent wildlife disturbances from occurring and, to prosecute with the support of local police forces where necessary. Targeted \u2018Days of Action\u2019 involving Police, the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and RSPCA, in partnership with other organisations, have been taking place along UK coastlines across the Summer to focus on specific concerns regarding marine life for that area.

We are investigating what other actions could be taken to better protect seals, such as developing and distributing clear guidelines to boat operators, those partaking in recreational water sports, and the public.

There are no plans for a ban.", "details": "All wild birds are protected in accordance with the provisions set out in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Some species of birds, including the woodcock, are listed in Schedule 2 of the Act, and may be killed or taken outside the close season. In England and Wales, the open season for woodcock is from 1 October to 31 January. The close season helps to make sure that they are able to breed successfully and move between breeding and wintering grounds.\r\n\r\nThe first breeding Woodcock Survey was undertaken in 2003 and estimated a breeding population of 78,000 pairs. A further survey in 2013 estimated 55,000 pairs, representing a decline of 29%. During winter, our resident birds are joined by migrants from northern breeding populations, increasing the GB non-breeding population to 1.4 million individuals. The numbers in winter are increased as a result of birds arriving from northern Europe and western Russia. The woodcock has been on the red list of Birds of Conservation Concern in the UK since 2015 due to a severe breeding range decline. The species is also considered to have a \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 breeding population at the GB scale based on the recently published IUCN assessment for birds.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing work and research of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT), including its Woodcock Watch tagging project, will be key to a growing understanding of the woodcock and the pressures the species face. The work can help inform measures which may have a positive impact on breeding populations of the woodcock and offer a better understanding on their habitat requirements. Satellite tagging by GWCT will also provide further information on overwintering populations, migration routes, and the ecology of the UK breeding population.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the decline of the woodcock are not fully understood but are likely to include: disturbance; habitat loss as a result of land drainage; the drying out of natural woodlands; changes in surrounding woodland management; the maturation of new plantations; and overgrazing (reduction of the field layer) by deer.\r\n\r\nThe woodcock population is more likely influenced by the extent and quality of habitat, rather than shooting, and therefore the focus should be on measures such as those outlined below which will support the recovery of the woodcock.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the recovery of species in England, including wild birds such as the woodcock, and that is why within the Environment Act 2021, we have a requirement for a new legally binding target to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030. Furthermore, we plan to publish a Green Paper soon which will consider further actions that Defra can take to assist nature's recovery.\r\n\r\nThe woodcock will benefit from a number of woodland grant schemes funded by both the Countryside Stewardship scheme and the Nature for Climate Fund, some of which specifically target management for declining woodland birds. These grants include the Woods into Management Forestry Innovations Funds which aim to restore vulnerable woodland habitats, improve biodiversity and conserve threatened species, and the England Woodland Creation Offer, which has a Nature Recovery additional contribution for woodlands which restore nature and species.\r\n \r\nMore broadly, environmentally sustainable farming is fundamental to our new approach to England's agricultural system.  We are introducing three environmental land management schemes: the Sustainable Farming Incentive, Local Nature Recovery, and Landscape Recovery. These schemes will pay for activities to create, manage and restore habitats such as woodland, connecting isolated habitats to form networks, and species management, all of which have the potential to benefit woodland bird species such as woodcock.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n", "created_at": "2022-01-04T16:12:07.890Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-04T16:12:07.890Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 599738, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/599738.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the manufacture, import, sale and use of fireworks in the UK", "background": "Fireworks can cause injury and even death, frighten pets and wildlife, and are bad for the environment.", "additional_details": "", "committee_note": "", "state": "closed", "signature_count": 14357, "created_at": "2021-10-23T13:08:04.773Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-29T08:29:10.000Z", "rejected_at": null, "opened_at": "2021-11-01T10:24:21.369Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-01T22:59:59.999Z", "moderation_threshold_reached_at": "2021-10-25T19:52:28.000Z", "response_threshold_reached_at": "2021-11-07T08:59:28.000Z", "government_response_at": "2021-11-29T14:24:31.236Z", "debate_threshold_reached_at": null, "scheduled_debate_date": null, "debate_outcome_at": null, "creator_name": null, "rejection": null, "government_response": {"responded_on": "2021-11-25", "summary": "There is\u202fa\u202fcomprehensive regulatory framework\u202fin place that strikes the right balance allowing people to enjoy fireworks, whilst reducing risks and disturbances to people and animals.", "details": "There is\u202fa\u202fcomprehensive regulatory framework\u202falready\u202fin place for fireworks that the Government believes strikes the right balance allowing people to enjoy fireworks, whilst reducing risks and disturbances to people and animals. \r\n \r\nExisting legislation controls the sale, availability and use of fireworks. For example, there is an 11pm curfew in place for the use of fireworks, with later exceptions only for the traditional firework periods of November 5th, Diwali,\u202fNew Year\u2019s\u202fEve,\u202fand the Chinese New Year. Using fireworks outside the curfew hours is a criminal offence enforced by the Police and can lead to imprisonment and a substantial fine. There is also a 120-decibel limit on the fireworks available to consumers.\u202f \r\n \r\nCurrent legislation restricts retailers to only selling consumer fireworks during the seasonal celebrations as set out above.\u202fRetailers may only supply fireworks outside these traditional periods if they obtain a licence from their local licensing authority.\u202fLocal Authority Trading Standards work with retailers to ensure fireworks sold are safe, and they have powers to enforce against those who place non-compliant fireworks on the market.\u202fTrading Standards (and local fire and rescue authorities in metropolitan counties) can also enforce against those selling fireworks without an appropriate licence, for example, outside the normal selling period.\u202f\u202f\u202f \r\n\r\nFireworks must also have safety warnings on the label, and this includes category of firework, instructions on safety distances and means of ignition.\r\n\r\nThe main environmental impact of Fireworks is the emission of particulates. Fireworks events are normally short-lived and localised events, so whilst there are likely to be localised spikes around these events for short periods (hours) which may lead to exceedances of the 24-hour air quality objective for PM10, (Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010) these high concentrations will be short lived and not impact the annual mean objective. Short-term concentrations increases from firework displays can be amplified due to the weather conditions that may affect the dispersion of pollutants.\r\n\r\nThe Air Pollution in the UK report provides an annual assessment of air quality in the UK including an assessment of the impact of fireworks and bonfire night. The most recent report, published in 2020, can be found through the following URL: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/annualreport/viewonline?year=2020_issue_1#report_pdf.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no current plans to place further restrictions on the sale of fireworks to the public, but we continue to monitor the situation. We have been carrying out an programme of work on fireworks, in response to concerns raised by the public. This has included:\r\n\r\n- Commissioning research by Ipsos Mori that provided evidence on consumer attitudes towards, and behaviours around, using fireworks in the UK. The key findings have informed our public awareness campaigns and support the need to educate consumers on fireworks use. The report can be viewed here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-behaviours-and-attitudes-to-fireworks-in-the-uk.\r\n\r\n- Commissioning noise research to test the decibel level of commonly used fireworks, in response to issues raised around noise and disturbance. The objective of the testing work is to help us understand the decibel level associated with a range of fireworks and whether they are compliant with the regulations.\u202fThe results of the testing will be available in due course.\r\n\r\n- Engaging with Local Authorities\u202fand animal welfare organisations\u202fto better understand what specific issues they face.\r\n\r\n- Engaging with the fireworks industry to consider what action they can take to promote consumer safety.\r\n\r\n- Developing an annual public awareness campaign, working in partnership with a range of stakeholders, to promote the safe and considerate use of fireworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2021-11-29T14:24:31.233Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-29T14:24:31.233Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "BEIS", "name": "Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 326850, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/326850.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Hold a public vote on HS2 project as it is being paid for by the public", "background": "I would like a public vote/referendum on whether we want to spend in excess of \u00a3100 billion on a train project which will destroy or irreparably damage natural habitats and wildlife sites along the route.", "additional_details": "To me, the damage & cost to public land, wildlife & nature at a time of Environmental emergency & recession outweighs the long-term benefits of travel.

HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, bringing our biggest cities closer together, boosting productivity and rebalancing opportunity fairly across the country. Once operational, it will provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes. During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history\r\n \r\nHS2 is at the heart of our plans to build back better from Covid-19, creating thousands of jobs and providing certainty at a time when people need it the most. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.\r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament, and the Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable.\r\n\r\nThe Transport Secretary has made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson, the dedicated HS2 minister, is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. The Department for Transport has also established a monthly Ministerial Task Force to provide strategic oversight, support and challenge for the successful delivery of Phases One and 2a. Earlier this year, Government reset the funding regime for HS2 Phase One including a Target Cost and funding envelope as well as providing revised estimates for the wider scheme, subject to the ongoing work on the Integrated Rail Plan.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to hold a public vote on whether HS2 proceeds.\r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. That is why the UK was the first major economy in the world to legislate for net zero and why we have published a 25-year Environment Plan setting out what we will do to protect and enhance our natural environment for future generations. The UK is decarbonising faster than any other country in the G20 and is providing global leadership on climate change.\r\n\r\nThe environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One of the scheme. Alongside the Act, the Government also published the Environmental Minimum Requirements, a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project.\r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. On Phase One alone over 33 square kilometres of new and existing wildlife habitat will be created, an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations.\r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

This commitment is  stated in the National Planning Policy Framework and supporting guidance, to which all local planning authorities should have regard when drawing up local plans, or determining planning applications.  The Framework expects local authorities to not only protect landscapes, soils and sites of biodiversity but go further by enhancing these valued surroundings. The Framework also outlines that the character and beauty of the countryside, including trees and woodland, should be recognised in the planning of future development.  Strong protections are in place for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated land. The Government will continue to apply policy and law as appropriate to prevent harm to wildlife-rich habitat, and to restrict development in open countryside.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to making the most of brownfield land.  The Framework strongly encourages regeneration and re-use of brownfield, especially for housing - helping to level up communities across the country while taking off some of the pressure to consider other land, such as Green Belt, for new homes. The Framework expects local authorities to give substantial weight to re-using suitable brownfield when Plan-making or deciding planning applications. These sites should be given priority where practical and viable, and local authorities should consider building up, and higher densities in towns.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n- the term \u2018brownfield\u2019 comprises almost all types of previously developed land, including inhabited housing and land occupied by functioning businesses and industry;   \r\n- not all vacant brownfield is in the right place for sustainable residential use; \r\n- some is valuable for ecology; \r\n- some has high upfront costs for demolition or decontamination; \r\n- each local authority is already required by law to publish a register of brownfield land in its area that would be suitable for housing-led development;\r\n- not all owners will wish to develop or release sites, for different reasons; and \r\n- the rules on compulsory purchase of building sites are strict, and generally require compensation for the owner, reflecting the current land value.\r\n\r\nElected local authorities are responsible for deciding the right location and type of sustainable future development in each area, in accordance with national policies in the Framework. Rightly, planning decisions are not made on the basis of the number of objectors or supporters. Instead, each local authority is responsible for preparing a vision for future development in its area using a Local Plan. The Local Plan outlines how land should be used and takes account of any necessary restraints on development. The Plan is created in consultation with the local community, and submitted for rigorous independent examination by a planning inspector. If the Plan is judged to be properly prepared, justified, and consistent with national policy in the Framework, it can come into effect. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that to help make home ownership affordable for more people, and help more people rent their own home, we need to deliver more homes. To get enough homes built in the places where people and communities need them, a crucial first step is to plan for the right number of homes. Local housing need introduced in 2018 is a measure of an area\u2019s housing need, against which councils must then consider their local circumstances and supply pipeline. Local authorities draw up a local housing target, taking into account factors including land availability and environmental constraints such as Green Belt. Following consultation to changes to the method (from August to October 2020) on 16 December 2020 we changed the formula to increase need in the 20 most populated urban areas. \r\n\r\nProtecting the Green Belt remains a priority and our national planning policy reinforces regenerating previously developed land, known as brownfield sites, and prioritising urban areas. The uplift in local housing needed within our biggest cities and urban centres in England will direct homes to where they are better served by infrastructure, and therefore protect our countryside. It also supports our wider objectives of regenerating brownfield sites, renewal, and levelling up. Green Belt decisions as outlined above will remain with local authorities and communities, ensuring they have influence over development, location and design.\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to apply strong policies to limit harm to Green Belt and the countryside, this Government is encouraging local authorities to make the most of their brownfield land. We are providing extensive financial support for this.  For example, in 2020 the Prime Minister announced that seven Mayoral Combined Authorities would receive a share of the \u00a3400 million Brownfield Housing Fund. This will help unlock 26,000 homes across England by bringing under-utilised brownfield land back into use. In addition we are investing \u00a375 million in a Brownfield Land Release Fund for authorities not eligible for the Brownfield Housing Fund.

Granting a felling licence does not change this; it simply authorises the felling of growing trees.", "details": "The Government responded to a petition on a similar issue on 29 January 2019.\r\n\r\nForestry is a devolved matter; in England the control of tree felling is the responsibility of the Forestry Commissioners under their powers in Part II of the Forestry Act 1967 (as amended). In most circumstances a landowner will require a felling licence from the Forestry Commission before they can legally fell their trees. When considering a felling licence application, the Forestry Commission will judge the proposals against the UK Forestry Standard: the Government\u2019s approach to sustainable forestry. This Standard encompasses the impacts on biodiversity and recognises the importance of priority habitats and species, including red squirrels, bats and dormice. Those applying for a felling licence are therefore required to provide evidence of how they propose to manage the impact of felling on wildlife. The Forestry Commission checks all applications against a large number of records, including Red Squirrel Reserves. This allows the Forestry Commission to highlight any potential issues and advise the applicant how to avoid the disturbance or damage of protected species. All felling licences are also issued with a European Protected Species checklist, which provides further guidance to applicants about their duties in relation to species such as dormice and bats. \r\n\r\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to intentionally kill, injure or disturb a protected species or intentionally or recklessly damage any place a protected species uses for shelter or protection, including during the breeding or nesting seasons. A felling licence does not remove this responsibility. There is a defence if a person can show that the act was the incidental result of a lawful operation and could not reasonably have been avoided, but this would require them to demonstrate that they had followed best practice and taken all reasonable steps to avoid the disturbance or damage. The need to do this is brought to an applicant\u2019s attention in a covering letter when they are issued with a felling licence.\r\n\r\nWhere other species affected are European Protected Species, which includes bats and dormice but not red squirrels, the defence of an incidental result of a lawful operation does not apply and the landowner must carry out an assessment of the possible impact on protected species and, if necessary, apply for a licence from Natural England. \r\n\r\nWhere proposed tree felling sites carry statutory designations to protect important features, such as biodiversity, the Forestry Commission is required to consult other relevant authorities and seek their agreement as to the appropriateness of any tree felling. This consultation may result in additional advisory notes being applied to a felling licence. Any additional permissions or consents that may be required, for example, Site of Special Scientific Interest consent from Natural England, must also be in place prior to felling taking place.\r\n\r\nIn the 25 Year Environment Plan the Government committed to increase the protection of existing trees and forests. While illegal felling rates are relatively low, evidence suggests that they are increasing. As illegal felling of any kind is unacceptable, Defra is proposing targeted changes through the Environment Bill which will support the Forestry Commission in helping to deter illegal felling activity and ensure that illegally felled trees are replaced.\r\n\r\nThe Government will consider whether there is a case for further strengthening any of these arrangements by amending forestry legislation as part of any regulatory review within the England Tree Strategy.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-01-05T14:13:19.638Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-05T14:13:19.638Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 300919, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300919.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the sale of artificial grass", "background": "The sale of artificial grass should be banned in the UK for environmental reasons.

For this reason, Defra and the Welsh Government commissioned an independent study in 2013 into the impacts of sky lanterns and helium balloons on the health and welfare of livestock. The report concluded that these impacts were relatively minor. Any action the Government takes must be proportionate to the level of risk and we have concluded that an outright ban would be disproportionate in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no legislation that specifically regulates the release of balloons or sky lanterns, voluntary actions and initiatives aimed at minimising the risks associated with sky lanterns and driving up safety standards have been effective. Initiatives include publication of a Trading Standards Institute voluntary code of practice for sky lanterns to ensure that they are manufactured to be safe and sold responsibly. Sky lanterns also fall in scope of the General Product Safety Regulations 2005 which oblige producers and distributors to place only safe consumer products on the market. These regulations are enforced by local authority Trading Standards services across the UK.\r\n\r\nWe have also provided local authorities with powers to restrict or ban the use of sky lanterns on council or public land and, as the petition notes, many local authorities have already put such measures in place.\r\n\r\nAs the law stands in England, it is conceivable that a magistrates\u2019 court would conclude that a release of balloons or sky lanterns constitutes a littering offence. Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 says: \u201cA person is guilty of an offence if he throws down, drops or otherwise deposits any litter in any place to which this section applies and leaves it\u201d. Ultimately it would be for a court to rule whether this phrase would cover balloon or sky lantern releases.\r\n\r\nCouncils in England have the necessary powers to take an individual whom they believe to be guilty of a littering offence to court or, as an alternative, issue a fixed penalty notice. Where a case does go to court, the magistrate will determine whether a particular incident constitutes a littering offence and, if so, the appropriate fine. It would be up to the council to decide whether bringing a prosecution for releasing balloons or sky lanterns was appropriate and a good use of its funds.\r\n\r\nThe Government considers the current voluntary and regulatory regime, supported by existing guidance on the safe manufacture and use of sky lanterns, is effective and proportionate. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2020-10-05T16:06:04.101Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-05T16:06:04.101Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608460, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608460.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Protect and restore Britain\u2019s lost rainforests", "background": "The UK Government should protect and restore Britain\u2019s lost temperate rainforests by producing a \u2018Great British Rainforests Strategy\u2019.
