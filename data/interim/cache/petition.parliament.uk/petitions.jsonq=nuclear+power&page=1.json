It is therefore important to make clear that any approval for a long-term infrastructure investment, such as at Bradwell B, to be built and to operate in the UK would depend on the project\u2019s viability and on its meeting the UK\u2019s stringent planning, environmental, security and safety standards, which are overseen by our robust and independent regulators. \r\n\r\nIt is likely that, as a generating station of more than 50MW generating capacity, the Bradwell B project will constitute a Nationally Significant Infrastructure project under the Planning Act 2008. This means that members of the public are able to raise concerns during the developer-run consultation before the developer submits an application for a Development Consent Order. \r\n\r\nIn June 2019, Government made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission to net zero, making the UK the first major economy to pass laws to end its contribution to global warming by 2050. This Government believes that nuclear will play an important role in the country\u2019s transition to Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Nuclear power can support the UK on this world-leading journey, as it is able to provide firm low-carbon power that can complement renewable electricity generation. Currently, nuclear energy provides around 20% of our electricity needs. However, based on current schedules most of the existing plants will be closed by 2030. \r\n\r\nThe potential benefits of nuclear to the UK in meeting our Net Zero commitment while sustaining a secure and cost-effective electricity system to support our economy mean that it is desirable for developers to come forward with proposals for new nuclear power stations that can be properly scrutinised and evaluated.\r\n\r\nAs we wrote in the opening paragraph of our response, we would like to reassure the public that any project will have to meet our stringent planning, environmental, security and safety standards, which are overseen by our robust and independent regulators. We have also highlighted some of the ways in which the public can raise any concerns they may have in respect of the specific project that is the subject of the petition so they can be taken into account at the appropriate time by the appropriate authority.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy", "created_at": "2020-07-23T14:52:22.384Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-23T14:52:22.384Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "BEIS", "name": "Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 311638, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/311638.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Halt Trident renewal and spend the funds on fighting the coronavirus.", "background": "Britain should halt its programme of Trident renewal and all work on its nuclear weapon systems, applying the funds, research and technology resources instead to provide vital equipment for the NHS and support the struggle against the coronavirus.", "additional_details": "At a time of national and international crisis, Britain can no longer afford to squander vast sums and scientific resources on a policy designed to counter the remote and improbable threat of nuclear attack.
