Properly regulated markets provide the best outcome for consumers as a driver of efficiency and innovation.", "details": "The Government does not agree that nationalisation of the country\u2019s strategic energy assets is the right approach.  A renationalised energy company would still have to buy the same expensive gas on global markets, so prices won't be lowered. Furthermore, if the Government renationalised energy companies, the British taxpayer would have to compensate directors, shareholders, and creditors to the tune of tens of billions of pounds \u2013 money that would be better spent supporting families.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, nationalised utilities run by politicians were in a bad state. These monopolies made considerable losses, were inefficient and needed considerable investment to upgrade age-old infrastructure. Since privatisation in the 1980s, the UK\u2019s energy system has attracted hundreds of billions of pounds in private capital \u2013 money that otherwise would have had to come from higher taxes or additional borrowing. This investment improved performance and reliability of Britain\u2019s energy network and offered consumers greater choice and higher standards of products and services. \r\n\r\nThe Government therefore continues to believe that properly regulated markets, which incentivise private capital to invest in the energy system, provide the best outcome for consumers and promote market competition as the best driver of efficiency, innovation and value.   This approach has served consumers well since energy privatisation, catalysing billions of pounds of investment and improving performance and reliability and offering consumers greater choice and higher standards of products and services.  \r\n\r\nThe Government has set out a comprehensive long-term plan for greater energy independence. The more clean, affordable power we generate within our borders, the less exposed we will be to eye watering fossil fuel prices set by global markets we can\u2019t control.\r\n\r\nThrough our Energy Security Strategy, we are working to our vulnerability to international oil and gas prices by reducing our dependence on expensive oil and gas. We will do this by accelerating the deployment of wind, new nuclear, solar and hydrogen, whilst supporting North Sea oil and gas in the nearer term for security of supply.\r\n\r\nNationalisation will not solve the current challenge of high global fossil fuel prices and the impact this is having on the cost of energy.  The Government has set out a comprehensive long-term plan for the energy system through the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution and Energy White Paper, both of 2020, and the British Energy Security Strategy of 2022.  These present a vision for how Britain can enjoy secure, clean and affordable home-grown energy for the long term.  In particular, the Energy Security Strategy charts a pathway to address our vulnerability to international oil and gas prices, by reducing our dependence on imported oil and gas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Government recognises that households and businesses across the UK are rightly concerned about rising energy bills.  We are taking action at an unprecedented scale.\r\n\r\nThe Government is providing \u00a337 billion of support this year, targeted at those who are most in need with the cost of living. This includes a \u00a315 billion Energy Bill Support Scheme, worth up to \u00a3400 each for around 28 million households. In addition, targeted support includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022 More than 8 million households on means tested benefits will receive a payment of \u00a3650\r\n\r\n\u2022 Over 8 million pensioner households which receive the Winter Fuel Payment will also receive a \u00a3300 Cost of Living Payment\r\n\r\n\u2022 Six million households which receive disability support will receive \u00a3150 Disability Cost of Living Payment\r\n\r\nAlongside this the Government is investing over \u00a36.6 billion over this parliament to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise heating. We will deliver upgrades to over half a million homes in the coming years through our Social Housing Decarbonisation, Home Upgrade Grant Schemes and Energy Company Obligation Scheme, delivering average bill savings of \u00a3300.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we have extended the Energy Company Obligation 2022 to 2026, boosting its value from \u00a3640 million to \u00a31 billion a year. This is helping an extra 450,000 families with green measures such as insulation. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "created_at": "2022-09-01T16:17:52.031Z", "updated_at": "2022-09-01T16:17:52.031Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2022-10-31", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-31/debates/D2E93BD7-1A0E-40FA-8829-0B3D9412F589/PublicOwnershipOfEnergyCompanies", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPBvGhYde4E", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2022-0184/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "BEIS", "name": "Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 300412, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300412.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Extend the transition; delay negotiations until after the coronavirus outbreak", "background": "The government should consider delaying negotiations so they can concentrate on the coronavirus situation and reduce travel of both EU and UK negotiators.

From April, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension will be over \u00a32,300 higher than in 2010.", "details": "The Government has no plans to increase the State Pension by \u00a3500 a year as an emergency measure. We have never paid our pensioners more. This year, we will spend over \u00a3129 billion on the State Pension and benefits for pensioners in Great Britain. From April, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension will be around \u00a3720 more in 2022/23 than if it had been up-rated by prices since 2010. That\u2019s a rise of over \u00a32,300 in cash terms.\r\n\r\nIn 2020/21, we introduced Primary legislation to increase State Pensions by 2.5 percent, higher than both inflation at 0.5 per cent and falling wages. The pandemic had caused the unusual fall in wages and meant if we had not taken that action, State Pensions would have been frozen for 2021/22. We also made a temporary change to the law to ensure the basic and new State Pensions increase by the higher of price inflation or 2.5 per cent for 2022/23. This means in April State Pensions will rise by 3.1 percent. Taken together, this means that over the last two years, we have delivered an increase of more than 5.6% in the basic and new State Pension.\r\n \r\nThe suspension of the Triple Lock for one year is a temporary response to exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic. This approach is fair to both pensioners and younger taxpayers. The Government remains committed to the Triple Lock for the remainder of this Parliament.\r\n\r\nPension Credit can provide further benefits and we want to ensure people receive all the support they are entitled to. Around 1.4 million eligible pensioners across Great Britain already receive some \u00a35 billion in Pension Credit, which tops up their retirement income and is a passport to other financial help such as support with housing costs, council tax, heating bills and a free TV licence for those over 75.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to tackling fuel poverty and protecting low income and vulnerable households. Latest figures show 200,000 fewer pensioners in absolute poverty, both before and after housing costs, compared to 2009/10.\r\n\r\nThe Winter Fuel Payment provides pensioners with support for their energy bills over winter worth \u00a32 billion every year \u2013 \u00a3200 for households with someone who has reached State Pension age and is under age 80; or \u00a3300 for households with someone aged 80 and over. Cold Weather Payments give further help to vulnerable people in receipt of certain income-related benefits, including Pension Credit, to meet additional heating costs during periods of unseasonably cold weather between 1st November and 31st March.\r\n \r\nIn addition to the provisions announced by the Chancellor on 3 February 2022 (the Chancellor\u2019s Statement is available here), the Warm Home Discount Scheme provides short-term support with energy bills through rebates, helping households stay warm and healthy in winter. The scheme provides those on Pension Credit Guarantee Credit with a rebate off their winter energy bill providing their supplier is part of the scheme.\r\n\r\nWe have already consulted on expanding the Warm Homes Discount by almost a third from 2.2 million to 3 million vulnerable households and increasing the rebate value to \u00a3150 from \u00a3140 each year, increasing the cost from \u00a3350 million to \u00a3475 million. We also consulted on expanding the eligibility to include all means-tested benefit recipients, bringing in those in receipt of Working Tax Credits and Pension Credit Savings Credit, and making the issue of the rebate more automatic for those on working age benefits who are living in the least energy efficient homes. BEIS have not yet published their consultation response but do plan to proceed on this basis from 2022/23.\r\n\r\nIn addition, almost \u00a334 million worth of support was provided in 2020/21 to those most at risk of fuel poverty through Industry Initiatives like debt relief, energy advice and energy efficiency improvements. A \u00a3500 million pound Household Support Fund was introduced last November to assist vulnerable households across the country this winter.

While shale gas could play a part in the UK\u2019s future energy mix, the government has always been clear that its development must be safe.\r\n\r\nThe current pause on hydraulic fracturing for shale gas was implemented in November 2019 on the basis of the difficulty in predicting and managing seismic activity caused by the process.\r\n \r\nThis followed hydraulic fracturing activities conducted in Lancashire that caused tremors that were widely felt by residents in surrounding areas, in some cases causing minor property damage.\r\n\r\nFollowing this event, analysis conducted by the expert regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (formerly called the Oil and Gas Authority), concluded that further analysis would be needed to confirm whether hydraulic fracturing could be done safely.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the NSTA would need to see improvements in:\r\n\r\n - the prediction of whether a site will be seismogenic;\r\n\r\n - the prediction of the likelihood, magnitude, sequencing and timing of seismic events that could be triggered by hydraulic fracturing operations at a site; and\r\n\r\n - the ability to predict faults and their seismogenic susceptibility from, for example, seismic surveys.\r\n\r\nThis is needed so that more effective precautionary and mitigation measures can be considered in future hydraulic fracturing plans.\r\n\r\nFor shale gas to become a significant contributor to the UK's energy supply, a significant number of wells would need to be drilled. This is because shale gas is very different to the UK\u2019s typical offshore gas production, where a small number of wells can be sufficient to drain the gas from an entire field. Shale gas extraction instead relies on a continued series of new wells, each of which produces gas for a relatively short time.\r\n \r\nIt remains government policy to minimise disruption and damage to those living and working nearby to shale gas exploration sites. Given the lack of new, compelling evidence confirming that hydraulic fracturing can be done safely, the Government does not feel it is appropriate to lift the pause on hydraulic fracturing at this time.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

The Government is committed to a decent State Pension as the foundation of support for people in retirement.", "details": "The Government spends over \u00a3134 billion each year on benefits for pensioners, including over \u00a3110 billion on the State Pension. This is likely to increase substantially in 2023/24. This proposal would add significant costs and make the system unsustainable and create additional burdens on the working age population.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension has risen by over \u00a32,300, in cash terms. That's \u00a3720 more than if it had been uprated by prices, and \u00a3570 more than if it had been uprated by earnings. The Government remains committed to implementing the Triple Lock in the usual way for the remainder of the Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis petition raises a comparison between the pre-2016 system, and the new State Pension which was introduced for those reaching State Pension age after 2016. The new State Pension was introduced to provide a simpler, clearer, and sustainable foundation for private saving. The new system was designed to cost no more than the previous system and care has been taken to ensure fairness to both groups. It is not possible to make direct, like for like comparisons between State Pension amounts between the two systems. It is not accurate to say that people who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 only received the basic State Pension. People who were not contracted out would also have built up some additional State Pension, or SERPS. Those who were contracted out would have received the benefits of membership of an occupational or personal pension scheme, as well as paying less into the national Insurance system at that time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the systems are different, they both reflect the National Insurance contributions an individual has made. Most people in the early years of the new system will get a similar State Pension to that they would have received under the previous system. \r\n\r\nThe State Pension operates under a contributory principle. This means that all individuals build up their National Insurance record during their working lives, in the expectation that they are contributing toward the payments of benefits for themselves and others on a pooled basis, including the State Pension. Upon reaching State Pension age, the State Pension is paid to everyone who is eligible and has contributed in this way, with the amount awarded based upon their National Insurance record. \r\n\r\nThe Government also provides additional support to older people, which includes the provision of free bus passes, free prescriptions, Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments.\r\n\r\nPension Credit is a means tested benefit and provides a top up for people of State Pension age to a weekly minimum amount, (currently \u00a3182.60 for single people and \u00a3278.70 for couples). These amounts may be higher for those with caring responsibilities, a severe disability or certain housing costs.  This approach ensures that spending is targeted at those most in need.  Information about Pension Credit is available from the Government website \u2013 www.gov.uk by entering \u2018Pension Credit\u2019 into the search bar.\r\n\r\nIn response to the current cost of living concerns, the Government understands the pressures people are facing and is providing over \u00a337 billion of support this year. This includes the \u00a3650 Cost of Living Payment, payable in two lump sums, which targets support at low-income households on means-tested benefits, including Pension Credit. In addition, pensioner households will receive a separate one-off payment of \u00a3300 (through and as an addition to the Winter Fuel Payment). All households with a domestic electricity bill will also benefit from the \u00a3400 support being provided through the Energy Bills Support Scheme.  \r\n\r\nOn international comparisons, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between State Pension schemes in different countries because there are many fundamental differences in the way they are run. There are many factors to take into account such as different tax systems, cost of living, access to occupational pensions and availability of other social security benefits, Health and Social Care systems, as well as the provision of services and goods free to pensioners or at concessionary rates.\r\n \r\nHowever, OECD rankings show that, due to Government reforms including the new State Pension and Automatic Enrolment, the UK\u2019s pensions system will provide future workers with income replacement rates which are comparable to the OECD average and higher than countries such as Switzerland, Norway, and Germany.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions", "created_at": "2022-08-23T07:14:13.411Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-23T07:14:13.411Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DWP", "name": "Department for Work and Pensions", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608007, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608007.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Allow consumers the right to refuse the \u00a3200 energy rebate", "background": "Stop forcing people to accept a loan for energy without the right of refusal.

The UK cannot be neutral about this egregious violation of international law. Instead, we and our international partners are united in condemning Russia\u2019s actions. At the UN General Assembly last month, 143 states voted to condemn Russia\u2019s attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory. Just 4 states voted with Russia (North Korea, Belarus, Syria, Nicaragua). The UK Government is proud to stand with the international community against Russia\u2019s naked aggression \u2013 and for freedom, democracy and the sovereignty of nations around the world.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government is also clear that it is Putin and the Russian Government that are to blame for the far-reaching consequences of the invasion of Ukraine. As well as being a clear assault on the global principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, Russia\u2019s brutal war has caused a massive humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the region. Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine continue to cause suffering on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a threat to us all. It has caused serious shocks to global energy markets and led to increasing prices across Europe. The UK Government is taking action to support British consumers and businesses cope with the impact of rising energy costs. The Russian invasion has also had wider global economic impacts, particularly on food prices. Putin\u2019s claim that these are caused by Western sanctions is false, and intentional Russian disinformation. It was Russia\u2019s cynical blockade on Ukrainian grain exports that has fuelled hunger and exacerbated humanitarian crises in areas already suffering, like the Horn of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the UK will continue to work together with our Allies to help Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression, and to bolster wider European security and stability. \r\n\r\nThe UK has committed \u00a32.3bn of military support to Ukraine this year. That support, including the new provision of air defence capabilities to protect Ukrainian civilians from growing Russian missile and drone attacks, will enable Ukraine to defend itself against Russia\u2019s brutal attacks and to push Russian armed forces from sovereign Ukrainian territory.\r\n\r\nWe are also supporting Ukraine with \u00a3220m in humanitarian assistance.

In the eight months since Russia began its unprovoked, illegal invasion, Ukraine has shown extraordinary resolve in resisting Russia\u2019s assault \u2013 and is now pushing Russian forces back from Ukrainian territory. The steadily changing map shows that Ukraine has the capability to defeat the Russian invasion, if we provide it with the support to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is for the democratically elected Ukrainian government to decide when and on what terms it would enter negotiations with Russia. But there is currently no indication that Putin is serious about negotiation; for genuine negotiations to take place, Russia must first cease shelling the Ukrainian people and halt its military operations.  Ensuring that Ukraine is in the best possible position to negotiate at the appropriate time will require continued UK and international action and a broad range of diplomatic, military, economic and legal support.\r\n\r\nOn the basis set out above, the UK Government does not support holding a referendum on the UK\u2019s position towards Russia and Ukraine.
