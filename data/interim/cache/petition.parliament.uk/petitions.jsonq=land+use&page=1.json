That is why we are getting on with HS2.", "details": "Our absolute priority right now is on tackling the spread of COVID-19 to protect our NHS and save lives. \r\n\r\nThis is why the Government has made clear that it will do whatever is required to ensure that the NHS has the resources it needs, while taking unprecedented steps to support the economy and UK businesses at this difficult time. \r\n\r\nBut this does not mean we should delay work on our long-term plans to level up the country and invest in the country\u2019s future infrastructure. The decision earlier this year to proceed with HS2 will provide thousands of construction workers and businesses across the country with certainty at a time when they need it most. \r\n\r\nThe project will contribute towards sustainable growth in towns, cities and regions across the country, spreading prosperity and opportunity more evenly. It will act as a catalyst for job creation, the development of new homes and ultimately, the regeneration of major cities and towns along the HS2 route. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, HS2 will play a key role in achieving the UK\u2019s transition to carbon net zero by 2050. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer some of the lowest carbon emissions per passenger km \u2013 seven times less than passenger cars and 17 times less than domestic air travel in 2030. \r\n\r\nHS2 will also free up space on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Mainlines for more passenger and freight services. Rail freight produces 76% less CO2 per tonne of cargo compared to road haulage. Every extra freight train takes up to 76 lorries off the road. In short, by providing a cleaner, greener way to travel, HS2 will help cut the number of cars and lorries on our roads, cut demand for domestic flights, and help the country\u2019s fight against climate change.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Prime Minister has said that HS2 should only continue if costs are kept under tight control. So, when we made the decision to proceed with HS2 in February, this came alongside a package of reform measures to instil financial order, discipline and transparency, including a Ministerial Taskforce and dedicated HS2 Minister to oversee the project and provide accountability.  \r\n\r\nThe Department has also now published the Phase One (West Midlands to London) Full Business Case (FBC) for HS2. And, in April, HS2 Ltd issued \u2018notice to proceed\u2019 so its contractors can begin main construction works along the Phase One route. This provides certainty to thousands of construction workers and businesses across the country at this difficult time. This decision protects jobs and means that work can truly begin on delivering this transformational project. \r\n \r\nThis is why we are getting on with HS2, which already employs 9,000 people and is crucial to levelling up our regions, providing vital rail capacity and meeting our 2050 obligations on carbon reduction.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2020-06-01T15:44:19.419Z", "updated_at": "2020-06-01T15:44:19.419Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": ["covid-19"]}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 611113, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/611113.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban development on agricultural land to increase food self-sufficiency", "background": "The Government should immediately ban development of green land that has been or is used for farming.

National planning policy sets a clear presumption away from developing high-quality agricultural land where possible.", "details": "This Government has committed to broadly maintaining current levels of food production in the Food Strategy, to ensure our continued high levels of food security. Our high degree of food security is built on supply from diverse sources; strong domestic production as well as imports through stable trade routes. We produce 60% of all the food we need, and 74% of food which we can grow or rear in the UK for all or part of the year, and these figures have changed little over the last 20 years.\r\n\r\nThere will always be multiple pressures on our land which require individual landowners, managers and Government to make decisions about trade-offs. Striking the right balance between different land uses is an important task which DEFRA and DLUHC have been working closely on. The National Planning Policy Framework aims to protect the best and most versatile agricultural land from significant, inappropriate or unsustainable development proposals, recognising the economic and other benefits of this land. It sets out a clear presumption away from the use of high-quality agricultural land for development where possible.\r\n\r\nHaving an effective, up-to-date plan in place is essential to planning for and meeting housing requirements in ways that make good use of land and result in well-designed and attractive places to live. The Government expects local authorities to work together to plan for and deliver the homes and infrastructure our communities need. We are committed to making the most of brownfield land and existing policy for protecting greenfield remains firmly in place.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that there is not a direct correlation between the amount of land farmed and productivity. Around 60% of the food we produce comes from just 30% of farmed land, and some sectors do not necessarily need much land in order to expand the amount they are able to produce. It is possible to maintain our food production by harnessing new technologies and innovation, and taking advantage of opportunities to grow and eat more of our own food, while seeing some land use change in some other areas. We will be investing \u00a3270 million across farming innovation funding programmes until 2029, to unlock technologies to drive sustainable farming techniques which will help increase productivity and profitability and the sector\u2019s long-term resilience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep this closely under review. Recognising the importance of food security, in the Agriculture Act 2020 the Government made a commitment to produce an assessment of our food security at least once every three years. The first UK Food Security Report was published in December 2021. The report recognises the contribution made by British agriculture to our resilience, and the importance of strong domestic production to our food security. It considers the UK's food supply sources overall, noting that domestic production and diversity of supply are both important to our food security.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2022-08-05T15:13:52.970Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-05T15:13:52.970Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 605749, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/605749.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "End \u2018ghost' flights: reform historic rights to landing slots.

This supports lower fares, better availability of routes and higher service quality.\r\n\r\nUnder these rules, airlines that use our most crowded airports (that are slot coordinated under the Worldwide Airport Slot Guidelines) must operate at least 80% of slots during the current season, or risk losing their historic rights: the so-called \u201880:20\u2019 rule.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a severe shock for aviation demand which has continued to remain considerably suppressed. The usual competition rules, which were designed for a situation where airports enjoyed high levels of usage, were not appropriate when demand had fallen close to zero. As such, the rules requiring airlines to use slots in order to retain their historic rights were fully suspended for the Summer 2020, Winter 2020/21 and Summer 2021 seasons.\r\n\r\nThe UK\u2019s exit from the European Union means that it has been able to take a more tailored approach that reflect the UK\u2019s specific circumstances. The Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft (ATMUA) Act 2021 provides temporary powers to amend these rules where the evidence supports the need to do so. These powers last until August 2024, covering the Winter 2024/25 season.\r\n\r\nAs the pandemic has gone on and demand begins to recover, the Government is keen to support recovery. For the current Winter 2021/22 season the Government has used the ATMUA Act 2021 to amend the slot usage retention rules. For Winter 2021/22 this has been reduced from 80% to 50%, and we have also allowed airlines to hand back full series of slots before the start of the season if they are not going to fly them. The provision to allow airlines to hand back full series of slots goes further than the equivalent alleviation in the European Union for Winter 2021/22 which did not include a full series hand back. By encouraging airlines to hand back their slots where there is insufficient demand, this has dramatically reduced the volume of empty or almost empty flights. This has also provided other airlines with the opportunity to make use of these slots, where there is sufficient demand, with new entrants being awarded temporary slots at some of our most congested airports. \r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the latest available data and evidence, the Secretary of State decided that alleviation remains justified for the Summer 2022 season.\r\n\r\nA draft Statutory Instrument setting out arrangements for Summer 2022 was published on 24 January 2022. The measures balance supporting recovery, protection for those carriers operating in markets that are severely restricted and reducing environmental impacts. It sets a minimum usage ratio of 70% and strengthens the provisions for justified non-utilisation of slots.\r\n\r\nThe strengthened justified non-use provision protects carriers and avoids the environmental impact of empty or almost empty flights flying where COVID-19 related restrictions are in place and avoids empty or almost empty flights to destinations that have onerous travel restrictions. This is because carriers can now use justified non-use provision to cover foreseeable restrictions, even where  restrictions are in place before the start of the season. The UK also will now allow for early applications for justified non-use such as where long term restrictions are in place.\r\n\r\nThese slot alleviation measures are only temporary, however as part of the Government\u2019s future aviation policy we are actively looking at reform to the airport slot allocation process. We are developing the case and options for reforms to make the best use of airport capacity and deliver a better outcome for passengers.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that the aviation sector has a critical role to play in delivering the UK\u2019s net zero commitments. In July 2021 we published the Jet Zero Consultation which sets out our vision for the sector to reach net zero by 2050. The consultation closed in September and we continue to carefully consider responses in the development of our final Jet Zero Strategy which we aim to publish later this year.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already supporting a variety of technology, fuel and market-based measures to address aviation emissions. The Net Zero Strategy published in October 2021 confirmed our commitment to Jet Zero, for the UK to become a world-leader in zero emission flight and to build a world-leading sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. The Government announced \u00a3180 million of additional funding for the development of SAF plants in the UK, further supporting our ambition to see 10% SAF blended into the UK fuel mix by 2030.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2022-02-28T16:30:06.318Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-28T16:30:06.318Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 324613, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/324613.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Extend the 2026 deadline for the recording of historic footpaths & bridleways.", "background": "Extend the existing deadline of 1st January 2026 to record historic paths onto Definitive Maps (as required by the Countryside & Rights of Way Act 2000) for a further 10 years until 2036.\r\nRecording a single path can take years, more time is needed to record them all, or they will be lost for ever.", "additional_details": "Thousands of our historic Rights of Way, some used for centuries, are not officially mapped.
