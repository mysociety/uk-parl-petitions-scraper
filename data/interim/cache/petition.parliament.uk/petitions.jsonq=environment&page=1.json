The government is determined to do everything possible to ensure that no student is prevented from fulfilling their potential due to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nWe continue to believe that exams are the best and fairest way of judging students\u2019 performance and the Government is committed to GCSE, AS and A level exams taking place next year. The Department has been working closely with Ofqual, the exam boards and groups representing teachers, schools, colleges and students, to consider our approach to exams and other assessments for 2021. \r\n\r\nIn July, Ofqual ran a consultation on a range of possible measures, with the overriding aim of ensuring that exams and assessments are as fair as possible. Ofqual published its decisions (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2021) on the proposed changes on 3 August. These decisions include adaptations in a number of subjects, for example, removing the requirement to record the spoken language assessment in GCSE English language, and allowing GCSE students to observe, rather than undertake, practical science work. In some subjects with a high volume of content - GCSE history, ancient history and English literature \u2013 Ofqual confirmed that exam boards should change how they assess students next year by allowing a choice of topics in the exams. For GCSE, AS and A level geography, there are changes to the requirements relating to fieldwork, both to free up teaching time and to take account of the fact that public health restrictions may make it difficult for students to fulfil the requirements next year. A full list of all subject-level adaptations to exams and assessments in 2021 can be found at Appendix A in Ofqual\u2019s decisions document (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2021). On 12 October, the Government confirmed that no further subject-level changes to exams and assessments will be made for GCSEs, AS and A levels. This confirmation gives teachers, school leaders and pupils clarity on what will be assessed in exams next summer. The government also announced the decision to delay most GCSE, AS and A level exams next year by 3 weeks to free up additional teaching time. \r\n\r\nExams next year will be underpinned by contingency measures developed in partnership with the sector. The Education Secretary wrote to Ofqual on 12 October to ask the regulator to work closely with him, school and further education leaders, exam boards, unions and the higher education sector to develop these arrangements. More detail will be published later in the autumn, to ensure students have confidence that they will be fairly treated in terms of assessment in 2021. \r\n\r\nWe have announced a package worth \u00a31 billion to ensure that schools have the resources they need to help all pupils make up for lost teaching time. This package includes a universal catch up premium of \u00a3650 million and \u00a3350 million for a National Tutoring Programme for disadvantaged pupils. Whilst head teachers will decide how the money is spent, the Education Endowment Foundation has published guidance on effective interventions to help schools make the best use of resources. This \u00a31 billion package is on top of the \u00a314 billion three year funding settlement announced last year, recognising the additional work schools will need to do to help pupils to catch up.\r\n\r\nWe have also announced a 16-19 Tuition Fund, allocating up to \u00a396m as a one-off, one year, ring-fenced grant to school sixth forms, colleges and all other 16-19 providers. This will provide small group tutoring activity for disadvantaged 16-19 students whose studies have been disrupted as a result of COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThe Department has provided a range of resources to support schools in delivering remote education. Schools may draw on examples of remote teaching practices employed during school closures and develop their own approaches to providing remote education, as well as building on our work with sector-led initiatives such as Oak National Academy. This new organisation was created by 40 teachers from schools across England and is producing at least 180 hours of online lessons per week for Reception up to Year 11 across a range of subjects. There is also specialist content for pupils with SEND covering their specific educational needs.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also committed over \u00a3100 million to enhance remote education, including providing devices and internet access for vulnerable children who need it most. This funding is intended to ensure that every school has access to free, expert technical support in using Google for Education or Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 Education, where needed, by offering peer support from schools and colleges more experienced with the use of education technology. \r\n\r\nThe government is clear that the school curriculum should remain broad and ambitious, and all students should continue to be taught a wide range of subjects, maintaining their choices for further study and employment.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education", "created_at": "2020-10-21T16:52:24.636Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-21T16:52:24.636Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2020-12-07", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-12-07/debates/4FFF63BD-3E7E-4CD6-A1B1-1A8400F88AD8/Covid-19ImpactOnSchoolsAndExams", "video_url": "https://youtu.be/7r7ECc92V3g", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9045/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfE", "name": "Department for Education", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education"}], "topics": ["covid-19"]}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 563380, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/563380.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Stop work on HS2 immediately and hold a new vote to repeal the legislation", "background": "We ask Parliament to repeal the High Speed Rail Bills, 2016 and 2019, as MPs voted on misleading environmental, financial and timetable information provided by the Dept of Transport and HS2 Ltd.

This railway will play a vital role in delivering the Government\u2019s carbon net zero objectives.", "details": "The Government has carefully considered the merits and disadvantages of proceeding with HS2 and has firmly concluded that it should go ahead. HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, and help to rebalance opportunity fairly across the country. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.  During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history. \r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament. The Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable. Just this month, Andrew Stephenson MP, the dedicated HS2 minister, went before the Transport Select Committee to discuss HS2 in depth, and a record of this hearing can be found on Parliament.UK. \r\n\r\nMinisters have made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. \r\n\r\nWe are continuing work on managing the full impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on delivery of the HS2 programme. We intend to update Parliament on the latest position as part of the next six-monthly Parliamentary Report, expected in Spring 2021. \r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. The environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One. Alongside the Act, the Government also published a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project. \r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. Phase One expects to support 33 square kilometres of wildlife habitat - an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations. \r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nSecuring the land and property needed to construct the line of route across all Phases is vital to the programme\u2019s success and is often the first impact that we have on line of route communities. A range of statutory and non-statutory property compensation schemes are available that seek to compensate affected parties fairly while protecting the public purse.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to provide fair compensation for those directly and indirectly impacted but the process and disputes for claims can inevitably be traumatic for some. Andrew Stephenson commissioned a detailed review of the acquisition and compensation process to ensure that there is a renewed focus on those who are being impacted by the new railway. The report contained 36 recommendations which are actively being implemented which will see rapid improvements for local communities. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to repeal any legislation relating to the development and delivery of HS2.  However, we will continue to welcome further public and parliamentary scrutiny of the project. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport", "created_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-14T17:05:16.758Z"}, "debate": {"debated_on": "2021-09-13", "transcript_url": "https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-09-13/debates/3614AE85-A25C-4874-9DAE-9802247DFDDF/HS2", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yt-9ZsO5vg", "debate_pack_url": "https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9313/", "overview": ""}, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfT", "name": "Department for Transport", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 567681, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/567681.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Grant an urgent Amnesty to Undocumented Migrants living in the UK", "background": "Undocumented Migrants are suffering  in silence, with no access to adequate Financial support, or any help.

We are monitoring the path of the pandemic and its impact on education closely, but it remains the government\u2019s firm intention that exams and assessments will go ahead in 2022.\r\n\r\nWe do recognise, however, that students taking exams in 2022 have experienced disruption to their education due to the ongoing pandemic. In recognition of this, the department and Ofqual held a widescale programme of sector engagement, including through a public consultation, (available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2022) to consider proposed changes to the assessment of GCSEs, AS and A levels. Our proposals received a high degree of support in the consultation, and the department and Ofqual have now confirmed a package of measures to help reduce pressures on students and teachers in the coming year and ensure exams can go ahead fairly (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/adaptations-in-2022-summer-examsto-ensure-fairness-for-students).\r\n  \r\nAs part of these measures, we have confirmed that advance information about the focus of the content of the majority of GCSE, AS and A level exams will be deployed by 7 February to support revision, although we retain the flexibility to deploy this earlier if there is significant further disruption to education. The advance information will be carefully considered to give students support with focusing their studying and revision but not so detailed that exact answers could be developed in advance. This is in line with our principles of fairness, flexibility and certainty with maintaining the standard and rigour of qualifications. This process will be managed by Ofqual working with the exam boards. Advance information will also be available for students sitting the November 2022 GCSE English language and mathematics re-sit exams. There will be advance information deployed for both subjects in July, and a formulae sheet will be available for mathematics. In addition, we are investing almost \u00a35bn to help children and young people to catch up on missed learning. This includes high quality tutoring, additional funding for schools and additional hours in 16-19 provision. For Year 13 students, providers offered them the opportunity to repeat their final year in 2021-2022 if they had been particularly severely impacted by the pandemic. We prioritised keeping schools open for the most vulnerable children and we supported all students by ensuring schools were the last to close and the first to open. We have also invested \u00a3520 million in remote education, with 1.65million laptops and tablets delivered.\r\n\r\nThere will also be optional topics and content in GCSE English literature, history, ancient history and geography exams. Ofqual will require exam boards to change how they assess these subjects to reflect the expected changes to the way the subject content is assessed, as proposed in the consultation.\r\n\r\nOfqual has also confirmed changes to the assessment requirements for practical assessments in some subjects to take account of any public health measures that may be in place and relieve pressure on teaching\u202ftime, and confirmed that students will be allowed to have access to support materials in the exam room in GCSE mathematics, combined science, and physics.\u202f\u202f \r\n\r\nIn the interests of fairness to students, and maintaining public confidence in grading, Ofqual has also confirmed that 2022 will be a transition year for grading and has set out its plans for a mid-point between 2021 and pre-pandemic grades (https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/ofquals-approach-to-grading-exams-and-assessments-in-summer-2022-and-autumn-2021). This reflects that we are in a pandemic recovery period and students taking exams in 2022 have experienced disruption to their education.\r\n\u202f \r\nWe believe that, taken together, these measures provide the best opportunity to support\u202fyoung people to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding and move on to their next stage of education,\u202ftraining\u202for employment.\u202f \r\n\r\nAlthough we are committed to exams going ahead this year, supported by the above adaptations, we understand that contingency arrangements are also needed to deal with the unlikely event that exams cannot go ahead fairly or safely. \r\n\r\nFollowing a joint consultation with Ofqual, we have confirmed that should GCSE, AS and A level exams not be able to go ahead, students will receive Teacher Assessed Grades (TAGs) instead. We have confirmed some changes to the 2021 TAGs process, which take account of lessons learned from 2021 and minimise burdens on both teachers and students. As was the case in 2021, the contingency arrangements would not allow for grades awarded to be based on predicted grades: they would be based on a range of evidence, and Ofqual has published guidance on the collection of this evidence across the academic year in case it is necessary to implement the contingency arrangements (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-contingency-arrangements-for-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-summer-2022/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-other-exam-centres-on-contingency-arrangements-for-students-entering-gcses-as-and-a-levels-the-advanced-extension#guidance-on-collecting-evidence-to-be-used-to-determine-tags-if-they-are-needed-in-summer-2022). \r\n\r\nOur position remains that exams will go ahead in 2022 with advance information being deployed by 7 February.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education", "created_at": "2022-01-10T17:07:24.296Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-10T17:07:24.296Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfE", "name": "Department for Education", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 332711, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/332711.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Reject the proposals for Junction 10 of the A3/M25", "background": "Calls on the Secretary of State for Transport to reject the Development Consent Order for Highways England\u2019s proposals for Junction 10 of the A3/M25.

Over 24.4 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and over 1.6 million people have received their second dose. There are now over 2700 sites across the UK already offering vaccines to those at risk by age and clinical priority. The network will continue to expand and evolve as we progress the deployment in the months ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is the independent medical and scientific expert body which advises the UK Government on prioritisation for all vaccines. The committee\u2019s membership is made up of practising clinicians and individuals from academia who have considered and continue to consider the impact of Covid-19 and population prioritisation as new data emerges.\r\n\r\nFor phase one of the vaccine roll-out, the underlying principles at the forefront of the advice by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation are; to reduce mortality, to protect the health and social care systems, and to save lives. Given the current epidemiological situation in the UK, all evidence indicates that the best option for preventing mortality in the initial phase of the programme is to directly protect persons most at risk. Having identified age as being the biggest determining factor to increased mortality, vaccinations have been prioritised to care home residents and staff and those over 80, followed by health and social care workers, then to the rest of the population in order of age and clinical risk factors.\r\n \r\nIn line with the JCVI\u2019s advice, special education staff will not be prioritised for a COVID-19 vaccination. There are currently no plans to deviate from the JCVI\u2019s advice on prioritisation.  There are very few cases where children and young people are considered Clinically Extremely Vulnerable (CEV). Frontline social care workers will be eligible for vaccination under Phase one of the programme where they are involved in providing direct care closely and regularly to those patients, in a health or social care setting. The Local Authority Director of Adult Social Services should have ultimate responsibility for identifying eligible Social Care Workers, underlined by the principle aim of achieving high rates of vaccination amongst frontline social care workers who work closely and regularly with those who are clinically vulnerable to COVID.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if a special school staff member is identified as being in one of the other at-risk cohorts, they will be contacted by the NHS at the appropriate time based on JCVI advice.\r\n\r\nThe NHS has now started to vaccinate the next set of cohorts (JCVI cohorts 5 to 9), with the goal of offering everyone who is most at risk, because they are over 50 years of age or have certain underlying health conditions, a first dose of the vaccine by 15 April. The Government aims to offer everyone aged 18 and over their first dose by 31 July.\r\n\r\nWe thank the special school staff for all the incredible work they have been undertaking throughout the pandemic, and we are working hard to ensure everyone who has been clinically prioritised to receive a vaccine will have access to a vaccine as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

Guidance for full opening: schools - GOV.UK sets out this position. \r\n\r\nThe decision not to resume overnight educational visits, including residential trips at this stage has been heavily influenced by the public health advice available and the Government\u2019s need to put in place measures to reduce and bring under control the rising cases of COVID-19 in England.     \r\n\r\nPublic Health England has advised that the resumption of residential visits will unnecessarily increase the risk of transmission of the virus due to a number of factors, some of which are listed below:  \r\n    \r\n\u2022\tincreased social interaction of groups of children and adults outside of their established bubbles\r\n\u2022\tincreased contact time with others in an indoor setting \r\n\u2022\tsharing bedroom facilities\r\n\u2022\tsharing of accommodation more broadly and close living arrangements (including sharing facilities such as canteens, showers and toilets)\r\n\u2022\tadditional travel across country and the interaction with others that the children and adults accompanying them would not otherwise encounter\r\n\r\nThe risks associated with these factors will vary from trip to trip and residential centre to centre. \r\n\r\nThis position will be reviewed again in November 2020. The review will, amongst other things, consider the risk factors described above and the position of the country as a whole in driving down the prevalence of the virus.  \r\n\r\nThe Government has made available to UK businesses a number of support measures and more information on business support can be found at Coronavirus (COVID-19): Business support - GOV.UK and the recently announced Job Support Scheme - GOV.UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education", "created_at": "2020-10-13T16:08:45.139Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-13T16:08:45.139Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DfE", "name": "Department for Education", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education"}], "topics": ["covid-19"]}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 599738, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/599738.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Ban the manufacture, import, sale and use of fireworks in the UK", "background": "Fireworks can cause injury and even death, frighten pets and wildlife, and are bad for the environment.", "additional_details": "", "committee_note": "", "state": "closed", "signature_count": 14357, "created_at": "2021-10-23T13:08:04.773Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-29T08:29:10.000Z", "rejected_at": null, "opened_at": "2021-11-01T10:24:21.369Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-01T22:59:59.999Z", "moderation_threshold_reached_at": "2021-10-25T19:52:28.000Z", "response_threshold_reached_at": "2021-11-07T08:59:28.000Z", "government_response_at": "2021-11-29T14:24:31.236Z", "debate_threshold_reached_at": null, "scheduled_debate_date": null, "debate_outcome_at": null, "creator_name": null, "rejection": null, "government_response": {"responded_on": "2021-11-25", "summary": "There is\u202fa\u202fcomprehensive regulatory framework\u202fin place that strikes the right balance allowing people to enjoy fireworks, whilst reducing risks and disturbances to people and animals.", "details": "There is\u202fa\u202fcomprehensive regulatory framework\u202falready\u202fin place for fireworks that the Government believes strikes the right balance allowing people to enjoy fireworks, whilst reducing risks and disturbances to people and animals. \r\n \r\nExisting legislation controls the sale, availability and use of fireworks. For example, there is an 11pm curfew in place for the use of fireworks, with later exceptions only for the traditional firework periods of November 5th, Diwali,\u202fNew Year\u2019s\u202fEve,\u202fand the Chinese New Year. Using fireworks outside the curfew hours is a criminal offence enforced by the Police and can lead to imprisonment and a substantial fine. There is also a 120-decibel limit on the fireworks available to consumers.\u202f \r\n \r\nCurrent legislation restricts retailers to only selling consumer fireworks during the seasonal celebrations as set out above.\u202fRetailers may only supply fireworks outside these traditional periods if they obtain a licence from their local licensing authority.\u202fLocal Authority Trading Standards work with retailers to ensure fireworks sold are safe, and they have powers to enforce against those who place non-compliant fireworks on the market.\u202fTrading Standards (and local fire and rescue authorities in metropolitan counties) can also enforce against those selling fireworks without an appropriate licence, for example, outside the normal selling period.\u202f\u202f\u202f \r\n\r\nFireworks must also have safety warnings on the label, and this includes category of firework, instructions on safety distances and means of ignition.\r\n\r\nThe main environmental impact of Fireworks is the emission of particulates. Fireworks events are normally short-lived and localised events, so whilst there are likely to be localised spikes around these events for short periods (hours) which may lead to exceedances of the 24-hour air quality objective for PM10, (Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010) these high concentrations will be short lived and not impact the annual mean objective. Short-term concentrations increases from firework displays can be amplified due to the weather conditions that may affect the dispersion of pollutants.\r\n\r\nThe Air Pollution in the UK report provides an annual assessment of air quality in the UK including an assessment of the impact of fireworks and bonfire night. The most recent report, published in 2020, can be found through the following URL: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/annualreport/viewonline?year=2020_issue_1#report_pdf.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no current plans to place further restrictions on the sale of fireworks to the public, but we continue to monitor the situation. We have been carrying out an programme of work on fireworks, in response to concerns raised by the public. This has included:\r\n\r\n- Commissioning research by Ipsos Mori that provided evidence on consumer attitudes towards, and behaviours around, using fireworks in the UK. The key findings have informed our public awareness campaigns and support the need to educate consumers on fireworks use. The report can be viewed here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-behaviours-and-attitudes-to-fireworks-in-the-uk.\r\n\r\n- Commissioning noise research to test the decibel level of commonly used fireworks, in response to issues raised around noise and disturbance. The objective of the testing work is to help us understand the decibel level associated with a range of fireworks and whether they are compliant with the regulations.\u202fThe results of the testing will be available in due course.\r\n\r\n- Engaging with Local Authorities\u202fand animal welfare organisations\u202fto better understand what specific issues they face.\r\n\r\n- Engaging with the fireworks industry to consider what action they can take to promote consumer safety.\r\n\r\n- Developing an annual public awareness campaign, working in partnership with a range of stakeholders, to promote the safe and considerate use of fireworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2021-11-29T14:24:31.233Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-29T14:24:31.233Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "BEIS", "name": "Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 326850, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/326850.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Hold a public vote on HS2 project as it is being paid for by the public", "background": "I would like a public vote/referendum on whether we want to spend in excess of \u00a3100 billion on a train project which will destroy or irreparably damage natural habitats and wildlife sites along the route.", "additional_details": "To me, the damage & cost to public land, wildlife & nature at a time of Environmental emergency & recession outweighs the long-term benefits of travel.

HS2 will transform our country\u2019s transport network, bringing our biggest cities closer together, boosting productivity and rebalancing opportunity fairly across the country. Once operational, it will provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes. During construction, we want HS2 to be the most environmentally responsible major infrastructure project in UK history\r\n \r\nHS2 is at the heart of our plans to build back better from Covid-19, creating thousands of jobs and providing certainty at a time when people need it the most. This railway is a long-term investment which will bring our biggest cities closer together, boost productivity and provide a low-carbon alternative to cars and planes for many decades to come.\r\n\r\nHS2 has rightly been subject to a great deal of Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Phase One was the subject of considerable debate in Parliament during the passage of the High-Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Act 2017 (\u201cthe Phase One Act\u201d). The Phase 2a Bill is currently being taken through Parliament, and the Government agreed with the Oakervee Review's conclusion that splitting Phase 2b into smaller sections, and more than one Bill, could facilitate scrutiny in Parliament, and make its management and construction more manageable.\r\n\r\nThe Transport Secretary has made a clear commitment to greater transparency on HS2, and Andrew Stephenson, the dedicated HS2 minister, is reporting bi-annually to Parliament on the project. The Department for Transport has also established a monthly Ministerial Task Force to provide strategic oversight, support and challenge for the successful delivery of Phases One and 2a. Earlier this year, Government reset the funding regime for HS2 Phase One including a Target Cost and funding envelope as well as providing revised estimates for the wider scheme, subject to the ongoing work on the Integrated Rail Plan.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set out above, the Government has no plans to hold a public vote on whether HS2 proceeds.\r\n\r\nThis Government takes its environmental commitments extremely seriously. That is why the UK was the first major economy in the world to legislate for net zero and why we have published a 25-year Environment Plan setting out what we will do to protect and enhance our natural environment for future generations. The UK is decarbonising faster than any other country in the G20 and is providing global leadership on climate change.\r\n\r\nThe environmental impacts of HS2 were closely scrutinised by Parliament during the passage of the Phase One Act, which gives statutory and planning authority for the construction of Phase One of the scheme. Alongside the Act, the Government also published the Environmental Minimum Requirements, a suite of additional environmental commitments to further reduce the impacts of the project.\r\n\r\nAs well as environmental protections, a range of measures to mitigate and compensate for environmental impacts have been put in place. This includes a commitment to seek to achieve \u2018no net loss\u2019 to biodiversity and the creation of a \u2018green corridor\u2019 alongside HS2, which will provide bigger and better habitats for wildlife, and integrate HS2 into the landscape. On Phase One alone over 33 square kilometres of new and existing wildlife habitat will be created, an increase of around 30% compared to what\u2019s there now.\r\n\r\nAll environmental measures, whether they be the creation of new habitats or the enhancement of existing habitats, will be supported with long-term management plans and agreements. This will ensure that the new railway leaves a long-lasting legacy for both wildlife and future generations.\r\n\r\nHS2 will give us a step-change in capacity delivering better connectivity between our largest towns and cities. The Government\u2019s decision to proceed with HS2 supports our objectives on climate change as the railway will play a key role in decarbonising our transport sector. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer a low carbon alternative to cars and domestic air travel. It will also free up space on the existing railway for thousands more passengers to travel by rail and to move more goods by rail freight, taking lorries off our roads.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

This commitment is  stated in the National Planning Policy Framework and supporting guidance, to which all local planning authorities should have regard when drawing up local plans, or determining planning applications.  The Framework expects local authorities to not only protect landscapes, soils and sites of biodiversity but go further by enhancing these valued surroundings. The Framework also outlines that the character and beauty of the countryside, including trees and woodland, should be recognised in the planning of future development.  Strong protections are in place for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated land. The Government will continue to apply policy and law as appropriate to prevent harm to wildlife-rich habitat, and to restrict development in open countryside.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to making the most of brownfield land.  The Framework strongly encourages regeneration and re-use of brownfield, especially for housing - helping to level up communities across the country while taking off some of the pressure to consider other land, such as Green Belt, for new homes. The Framework expects local authorities to give substantial weight to re-using suitable brownfield when Plan-making or deciding planning applications. These sites should be given priority where practical and viable, and local authorities should consider building up, and higher densities in towns.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n- the term \u2018brownfield\u2019 comprises almost all types of previously developed land, including inhabited housing and land occupied by functioning businesses and industry;   \r\n- not all vacant brownfield is in the right place for sustainable residential use; \r\n- some is valuable for ecology; \r\n- some has high upfront costs for demolition or decontamination; \r\n- each local authority is already required by law to publish a register of brownfield land in its area that would be suitable for housing-led development;\r\n- not all owners will wish to develop or release sites, for different reasons; and \r\n- the rules on compulsory purchase of building sites are strict, and generally require compensation for the owner, reflecting the current land value.\r\n\r\nElected local authorities are responsible for deciding the right location and type of sustainable future development in each area, in accordance with national policies in the Framework. Rightly, planning decisions are not made on the basis of the number of objectors or supporters. Instead, each local authority is responsible for preparing a vision for future development in its area using a Local Plan. The Local Plan outlines how land should be used and takes account of any necessary restraints on development. The Plan is created in consultation with the local community, and submitted for rigorous independent examination by a planning inspector. If the Plan is judged to be properly prepared, justified, and consistent with national policy in the Framework, it can come into effect. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that to help make home ownership affordable for more people, and help more people rent their own home, we need to deliver more homes. To get enough homes built in the places where people and communities need them, a crucial first step is to plan for the right number of homes. Local housing need introduced in 2018 is a measure of an area\u2019s housing need, against which councils must then consider their local circumstances and supply pipeline. Local authorities draw up a local housing target, taking into account factors including land availability and environmental constraints such as Green Belt. Following consultation to changes to the method (from August to October 2020) on 16 December 2020 we changed the formula to increase need in the 20 most populated urban areas. \r\n\r\nProtecting the Green Belt remains a priority and our national planning policy reinforces regenerating previously developed land, known as brownfield sites, and prioritising urban areas. The uplift in local housing needed within our biggest cities and urban centres in England will direct homes to where they are better served by infrastructure, and therefore protect our countryside. It also supports our wider objectives of regenerating brownfield sites, renewal, and levelling up. Green Belt decisions as outlined above will remain with local authorities and communities, ensuring they have influence over development, location and design.\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to apply strong policies to limit harm to Green Belt and the countryside, this Government is encouraging local authorities to make the most of their brownfield land. We are providing extensive financial support for this.  For example, in 2020 the Prime Minister announced that seven Mayoral Combined Authorities would receive a share of the \u00a3400 million Brownfield Housing Fund. This will help unlock 26,000 homes across England by bringing under-utilised brownfield land back into use. In addition we are investing \u00a375 million in a Brownfield Land Release Fund for authorities not eligible for the Brownfield Housing Fund. This is new capital funding to accelerate release of local authority-owned land for housing. The Brownfield Land Release Fund is expected to release land for 7,000 homes by 2024.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government", "created_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-03T11:38:13.411Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 566467, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/566467.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Fund a national anti-littering campaign.", "background": "I would like to see the Government fund a national anti-littering campaign, to put this issue back into public awareness.

That number is growing, putting young people at the heart of environmental issues. More information about the\u202fprogramme\u202fcan be found at:\r\nwww.eco-schools.org.uk\r\n\r\nWe published the Litter Strategy for England in April 2017, setting out our aim to deliver a substantial reduction in litter and littering within a generation. The Litter Strategy brings together communities, businesses, charities and schools to bring about real change by focusing on three key themes: education and awareness; improving enforcement; and better cleaning and access to bins. A copy of the Litter Strategy can be found at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/litter-strategy-for-england\r\n\r\nLocal councils are responsible for keeping their public land clear of litter and refuse. It is up to councils to decide how best to meet this statutory duty. To help them, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), on behalf of Defra and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has recently published guidance for local authorities and Business Improvement Districts in England on the provision of litter bins.\u202f \u2018The Right Bin in the Right Place\u2019 guidance is available at:\r\nhttps://wrap.org.uk/content/binfrastructure-right-bin-right-place\r\n\r\nIn support of this guidance, WRAP recently ran a grant competition (funded by Defra) for local authorities in England to apply for grants of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a325,000 to purchase new litter bins. In total, 44 applications were approved, worth almost a million pounds. These new bins should help local authorities reduce litter through targeted interventions, where they are most needed.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n", "created_at": "2021-04-23T16:25:58.756Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-23T16:25:58.756Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 324896, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/324896.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Make Anti-Racism training mandatory in all UK workplaces", "background": "I want the government to make Anti-Racism training mandatory in all UK workplaces.

The result of such work is evident through our Resources and Waste Strategy and our ambition to eliminate crime and poor performance in the waste sector.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes the issue of odour from landfill seriously and there have been debates in Parliament on this topic, most recently on 19 May 2021.\r\n\r\nLandfill and other types of waste management facility are regulated by the EA in England, which issues and regulates environmental permits. These permits set limits, including for odours, within which operations can be undertaken without causing a significant impact on the environment. Whilst no landfill will ever be completely odour free, the level and type of odour arising from such operations should not be causing serious offence.\r\n\r\nWhere appropriate, operators must provide an Odour Management Plan describing measures they will take to minimise odour. The EA sets out how the monitoring should be carried out, the required competency of staff and the equipment to be used. If the plan is accepted, it is incorporated into the site\u2019s environmental permit as an \u2018operating technique\u2019. The operator should keep that plan under review and the plan can be required to be updated if there is a problem, or if it is not working as originally intended. The EA also imposes a condition that requires operators to use approved measures to manage their activity to minimise odour emissions. If operations are not being undertaken in accordance with these plans, then the EA has a range of enforcement powers they can and do use.\r\n\r\nMonitoring odour can be challenging, so there are no numerical limits for odour or particular gases in landfill permits. This is due to the variability of the gas composition, rapid dispersion once it escapes the waste mass and challenges in monitoring this. The EA therefore uses a condition in environmental permits which is based on \u2018offence to the senses\u2019; this means that the odour is assessed by the level of offence it causes to a trained EA officer.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate non-compliance, an EA officer must receive a report of odour, attend the location that the odour is reported, confirm it is coming from the site and demonstrate that the site is, or is not, doing something that has been specified in their Odour Management Plan or is contrary to Best Available Techniques. This condition has evolved over a number of years following prosecutions and case law derived from them. If non-compliance is confirmed, EA officers can take action in line with the Enforcement and Sanctions Policy.\r\n\r\nThe EA provides an incident response function to deal with environmental incidents. It prioritises incidents by focusing on those that have a human health impact, followed by environmental and amenity impacts such as odour, dust or noise. The scale and impact of the incident is also factored into this process, so a low impact incident from a health perspective which has attracted a lot of reports will be escalated and responded to. It is not possible for the EA to attend all the incidents it is notified of, so this process of prioritisation is used to attend higher risk incidents only.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities also have a role to play in managing issues considered to be a nuisance, including odour. If a waste management site is operating in a manner that is having an effect on local communities but is not contravening the conditions within the environmental permit, then the local authority has the power to act when determining if a statutory nuisance exists.\r\n\r\nThe determination of a statutory nuisance has two limbs: whether it is \u2018prejudicial to health\u2019 or a \u2018nuisance\u2019. To be a \u2018nuisance\u2019 the situation must unreasonably and substantially interfere with the personal comfort or amenity of those nearby. What is unacceptable is that which ordinary, decent people would consider unreasonable. If the local authority agrees that a statutory nuisance has happened or will happen in the future, then it must serve an abatement notice on the person, premises owner or occupier concerned.\r\n\r\nThe decision regarding whether or not an issue is a statutory nuisance is made by the local authority\u2019s Environmental Health Practitioner on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nThe Government wants to minimise the volume of waste sent to landfill, including eliminating food waste to landfill by 2030. By reducing the volume of waste that we send to landfill, in particular biodegradable waste, we will reduce negative impacts from landfill. The Government is also reforming the framework under which waste is transported and is committed to the mandatory electronic tracking of waste. This will prevent inappropriate and misclassified waste such as gypsum ending up in landfill where it can emit odours.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

For this reason, Defra and the Welsh Government commissioned an independent study in 2013 into the impacts of sky lanterns and helium balloons on the health and welfare of livestock. The report concluded that these impacts were relatively minor. Any action the Government takes must be proportionate to the level of risk and we have concluded that an outright ban would be disproportionate in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no legislation that specifically regulates the release of balloons or sky lanterns, voluntary actions and initiatives aimed at minimising the risks associated with sky lanterns and driving up safety standards have been effective. Initiatives include publication of a Trading Standards Institute voluntary code of practice for sky lanterns to ensure that they are manufactured to be safe and sold responsibly. Sky lanterns also fall in scope of the General Product Safety Regulations 2005 which oblige producers and distributors to place only safe consumer products on the market. These regulations are enforced by local authority Trading Standards services across the UK.\r\n\r\nWe have also provided local authorities with powers to restrict or ban the use of sky lanterns on council or public land and, as the petition notes, many local authorities have already put such measures in place.\r\n\r\nAs the law stands in England, it is conceivable that a magistrates\u2019 court would conclude that a release of balloons or sky lanterns constitutes a littering offence. Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 says: \u201cA person is guilty of an offence if he throws down, drops or otherwise deposits any litter in any place to which this section applies and leaves it\u201d. Ultimately it would be for a court to rule whether this phrase would cover balloon or sky lantern releases.\r\n\r\nCouncils in England have the necessary powers to take an individual whom they believe to be guilty of a littering offence to court or, as an alternative, issue a fixed penalty notice. Where a case does go to court, the magistrate will determine whether a particular incident constitutes a littering offence and, if so, the appropriate fine. It would be up to the council to decide whether bringing a prosecution for releasing balloons or sky lanterns was appropriate and a good use of its funds.\r\n\r\nThe Government considers the current voluntary and regulatory regime, supported by existing guidance on the safe manufacture and use of sky lanterns, is effective and proportionate. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2020-10-05T16:06:04.101Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-05T16:06:04.101Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DLUHC", "name": "Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities ", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 553694, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/553694.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Exempt amateur boxing from Covid-19 restrictions", "background": "Currently young people can go to a pub and drink but cannot take part in amateur boxing, unlike football, rugby and professional boxing.

In the event that that person has convictions for sexual offences against children, poses a risk of causing harm to the child(ren) concerned and a disclosure is necessary to protect the child(ren), there is a presumption that police will provide information to the individual most able to protect the child(ren). For this reason, the disclosure would not necessarily be made to the original applicant.\r\n\r\nThe Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (or \u201cClare\u2019s Law\u201d) enables the police to disclose to the public, information about previous violent offending by a current or former partner where this may help protect them from further violent offending.  Disclosures can be made: if the police have the power to disclose the information; if there is a pressing need for the information; and, if interfering with the rights of the subject (under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights) to have information about his/her previous convictions kept confidential, is necessary and proportionate for the prevention of crime (or in the interests of public safety or for the protection of morals or the rights and freedoms of others).\r\n\r\nHome Office", "created_at": "2021-01-26T18:56:03.257Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-26T18:56:03.257Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "HO", "name": "Home Office", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office"}], "topics": ["race-and-equality"]}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 307215, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/307215.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Pay bonus to all key workers", "background": "I hope that the key workers are recognised and rewarded for their invaluable contribution on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak situation!

The Government hugely values and appreciates these vital contributions to the COVID-19 response, both in the private and public sector.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government has agreed specific pay and pensions packages for a number of public sector workforces, including the NHS, both to increase system capacity and recognise their work.\r\n\r\nOn the 21 July 2020, the Government accepted the recommendations of the independent Pay Review Bodies and announced a significant, real terms pay increase for around 900,000 public sector workers across nine workforces, including teachers, police officers, and doctors and dentists. For the majority, this is the third inflation busting pay rise in a row.\r\n\r\nIn addition, more than one million NHS workers continue to benefit from the three-year Agenda for Change pay deal, under which the starting pay for a newly qualified nurse has increased by over 12% since 2017/18. The Government has also agreed a pay deal that provides junior doctors with a minimum 8.2% pay rise over four years.\r\n\r\nThe UK\u2019s economic response to COVID-19 is one of the most generous and comprehensive in the world. The Government is supporting those at work through the package of measures it has announced to protect against the current economic emergency. This includes significant changes to the operation of statutory sick pay, universal credit, and employment and support allowance, so that people have quicker and more generous access to a support system.\r\n\r\nThe Government has recently announced significantly above inflation pay awards for a large proportion of key workers, in addition to specific support packages that were agreed to address specific Covid-19 related pressures.

We are seeing more organisations, including the Royal Horticultural Society, helping to communicate the risks and issues surrounding the use of artificial grass in place of natural landscaping. \r\n\r\nThe 25 Year Environment Plan sets out our ambition to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste by 2042. Given the scale of the plastics problem, we need to take a targeted and evidence-led approach to tackling the issues of plastic waste. That is why our Plastic Packaging Tax and Collection and Packaging Reforms will help to reduce plastic waste, ensuring we keep as much material in circulation for as long as possible, by incentivising reduction, reuse and recycling of plastic at end-of-life.\r\n\r\nWe have no current plans to ban the sale of artificial grass, but in our recent call for evidence on commonly littered and problematic plastic items, we asked the public if there were any further plastic items we should consider for future policy action.

This will further incentivise public authorities to adopt approaches that improve the environment.

A bat Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA) has been conducted in 2022, and the following surveys are ongoing: bat activity surveys, bat roost surveys of buildings, invertebrate surveys, and a botanical survey.\r\n \r\nThe findings of these surveys have guided, and would continue to guide, the formulation of an appropriate mitigation response to the impacts of the proposed development. An ecology chapter would form part of the Environmental Statement for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) if a planning application is submitted.\r\n \r\nTo mitigate the ecological impact of building on this site, prison landscaping would use native planting and seed mixes as far as possible.  \r\n\r\nThe loss of any trees, scrub, and buildings would be mitigated/compensated. Brown hares use the site, and appropriate mitigation/compensation would be provided. Great crested newt impacts are limited to habitats on land (no ponds would be lost), and we propose following the District Level Licensing route with Natural England, to offset any impacts.\r\n  \r\nThe invertebrate surveys target a wide range of rare and notable species, including priority species. We are confident that the needs of any priority species can be accommodated within the habitat provisions envisaged.\r\n \r\nThe MOJ is committed to Environment Act and to the protection of wildlife. The MoJ currently operates a number of prisons in Sites of Special Scientific interest (SSSI\u2019s) and on sites with protected species of birds and other wildlife. Any proposals put forward for Planning Permission would have a commitment to protect the wildlife on the site and to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. \r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice\r\n", "created_at": "2022-06-15T15:57:02.431Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-15T15:57:02.431Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "MoJ", "name": "Ministry of Justice", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 331350, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/331350.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Include Windrush generations in British Nationality Act Remedial Order", "background": "The Government should expand the British Nationality Act Remedial Order to cover the Windrush generation and their descendants, as they have historic rights to apply to become British citizens.", "additional_details": "The Immigration Act 1971 gave the Windrush Generation rights to live and work in the UK, and secure British citizenship, but many faced difficulties availing themselves of these rights due to the hostile environment that was implemented subsequently.

This guaranteed in law their right to continue to permanently live and work in this country.  Some members of the Windrush generation subsequently had difficulties demonstrating their lawful status, and the Home Secretary has apologised unreservedly to victims and their families for the injustice, hardship and suffering they endured as a result.  \r\n\r\nThe Home Office\u2019s priority has been to ensure that those who have struggled to demonstrate their status are supported to do so.  The Windrush Scheme was launched in May 2018, to support members of the Windrush generation and their children to obtain documentation confirming their right to live and work in the UK.  The Scheme also allows eligible individuals who are not yet British citizens to apply to register or naturalise as British citizens free of charge.  Such individuals are not required to take a Life in the UK test or obtain an English language qualification.  To the end of August, the Home Office had provided over 13,300 documents to over 11,500 people confirming their status or British citizenship.  \r\n\r\nUnder most circumstances, UK-born direct descendants of members of the Windrush generation will be British citizens automatically from birth, if born prior to 1 January 1983 or after 1 January 1983 to at least one parent that was settled in the UK at the time of their birth. This can include a parent with indefinite leave to remain granted by the Immigration Act 1971, or a descendant of such a person who also held indefinite leave to remain or was a British citizen.\r\n\r\nDue to historic legislation, a child born between 1 January 1983 and 30 June 2006 would only have acquired British citizenship through their father if their parents were married. The law changed on 1 July 2006 to allow a person to acquire citizenship through their father, irrespective of whether their parents were married. This change was not made retrospective, in part because some people born before 1 July 2006 would by then have acquired foreign citizenships. Their entitlement to such citizenships might have been put at risk if they were deemed to have always held British citizenship.\r\n\r\nAny person born prior to 1 July 2006, who would have become a British citizen automatically had their parents been married, may choose to register as a British citizen free of charge.  The British Nationality Act 1981 (Remedial) Order ensures any individuals in this position may register as British citizens without needing to meet the requirement to be of good character.  This includes eligible descendants of members of the Windrush generation. The Government therefore has no plans to extend the order.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-02T16:59:31.691Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-02T16:59:31.691Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "HO", "name": "Home Office", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 562011, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/562011.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Reverse the decision to prevent yoga studios opening throughout tier 3.", "background": "Please consider a separate review for yoga studios to be removed from the class exemption category.
