In addition, the Government has acted quickly to assist zoos and aquariums through the Zoo Support Fund which has made up to \u00a3100 million available to help to maintain a high standard of care for their animals during the coronavirus pandemic. A portion of this funding has been awarded to zoos that are charities, which has enabled them to continue providing vital care to their wild animals. \r\n\r\nAs well as the Job Retention Scheme, charities are eligible to apply for a range of other support schemes including the VAT deferral, Business Rates Relief, the Business Interruption Loan schemes, the option to reclaim the costs of Statutory Sick Pay and grant funding of up to \u00a325,000 through the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that there will be further demands on the sector as we recover from the current pandemic and that these impacts will continue for some time even beyond the immediate end of the crisis. For example, there are concerns about increased abandonment of pet, and ensuring their continued care.\r\n\r\nThe Government welcomes the in-sector initiatives to help animal welfare charities with the launch of several emergency grant schemes, to assist animal rescue and rehoming centres. These initiatives have enabled the worst affected rescue centres to be assisted. We understand that the rescue fund schemes have been a success, in terms of raising money and highlighting those rescue centres most in need \u2013 in the cat, dog and equine sectors.  \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that many charities rely on legacy payments as a source of income. We know that there have been delays in charities receiving legacy income, which has impacted on their ability to continue their work, particularly at a time when other income sources may be reduced as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. However, waiting times have now greatly improved, and applications are continuing to progress, and grants issued in spite of the outbreak. \r\n\r\nWe continue to explore other mechanisms and initiatives that may help animal welfare charities to continue their invaluable work. \r\n\r\nOn 23 June, the Prime Minister announced further easing of the lockdown restrictions.
