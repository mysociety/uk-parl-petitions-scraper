These new targets will be an important mechanism to drive environmental improvement and meet our ambitious objectives for the water environment in the 25 Year Environment Plan.  \r\n\r\nThe Act places clear duties on water and sewerage companies to progressively reduce the adverse impacts of discharges from storm overflows and improve transparency of reporting when discharges occur.  \r\n\r\nThe Environment Agency is driving transparency with 80% of storm overflows now having Event Duration Monitors and all overflows will be monitored by the end of 2023, allowing water companies to report the frequency and duration of spills to the Environment Agency (EA) each year so they can assess compliance. The Environment Agency is acting on new information, suggesting that some water companies in England may indeed not be complying with their permits and a major Environment Agency/Ofwat investigation has been launched.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to funding the EA to improve the water environment. For example, we are providing additional funding to the EA to increase their farm inspection regime nationwide over the next 18 months. In 2021/2 this includes an expectation of a fourfold increase in farm inspections undertaken nationally with plans to scale up further in 2022/3.\r\n\r\nWhilst necessary to uphold basic standards, enforcement of the regulations alone are not sufficient because farmers need advice to understand the risks posed to water by agriculture and funding support where actions beyond regulatory requirements are needed to reduce pollution further.\r\n\r\nWe are expanding the Catchment Sensitive Farming Programme, almost doubling its funding by providing an additional \u00a317 million over the next three years to enable it to cover 100% of farms in England. Over the last 15 years this programme has been one of the main ways to help farmers tackle pollution which results from manure, fertiliser and soil running off into rivers when it rains. It provides free 1-2-1 advice to farmers to help them reduce water and air pollution through management of nutrients, soils, animals and infrastructure among other things.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "created_at": "2021-12-17T13:46:53.799Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-17T13:46:53.799Z"}, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 553090, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/553090.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Habitat Protection - Public inquiry and reform of protections", "background": "We need the Government to hold a public inquiry into why so many native species are struggling to survive and why so many are on the verge of extinction, which should result in reform of environmental laws and the Government\u2019s approach to protecting biodiversity.", "additional_details": "Research has found that one in seven species in the UK face extinction, and over 40% of species have experienced decline since 1970.\r\n\r\nA full public inquiry could establish the extent to which current laws provide adequate protections for UK species, and the effectiveness of Natural England and Defra, and whether any reforms to current laws and the Government\u2019s wider approach to protecting biodiversity are needed.", "committee_note": "", "state": "closed", "signature_count": 3571, "created_at": "2020-10-02T13:47:23.129Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-06T16:25:51.725Z", "rejected_at": null, "opened_at": "2020-11-04T17:41:42.686Z", "closed_at": "2021-05-04T22:59:59.999Z", "moderation_threshold_reached_at": "2020-10-12T18:05:54.000Z", "response_threshold_reached_at": null, "government_response_at": null, "debate_threshold_reached_at": null, "scheduled_debate_date": null, "debate_outcome_at": null, "creator_name": null, "rejection": null, "government_response": null, "debate": null, "departments": [{"acronym": "DEFRA", "name": "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"}], "topics": []}}, {"type": "petition", "id": 608803, "links": {"self": "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/608803.json"}, "attributes": {"action": "Regulate wildlife food so it\u2019s safer for hedgehogs, and all mammals & birds", "background": "Shockingly there are currently no regulations on foods sold to be given to wildlife.
